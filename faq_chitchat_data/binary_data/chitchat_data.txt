- A little @ASOS @asos_lovescurve haul:
- Wonder if I’ll live long enough to see if @ASOS figure how to stop sending you back to the top of the page when you’ve clicked off the 456th item!
- that’s the tweet.   cc: @ASOS
- ‘Where have you been hiding?’ Oh you know  I’ve just been staying in eating right and protecting my peace. Also got a ring light 🔮 Set: @asos  #unedited #natural
- Native Sound System 🌍🥇 @OvieSoko x @ASOS
- ‘@ASOS have up to 50% off everything’
- @vsatkins @lottyburns @ASOS I hardly ever buy anything in the Black Friday sales because they’re rarely any cheaper than they are in other sales of the year
- So proud of my sister man. First she won  now she’s officially a @ASOS designer. Her new collection is out now‼️❤️❤️
- Trying not to wear pink on every occasion but can’t help it now... 😅💕🤰@ASOS #maternity range 🤩
- @vsatkins @screebs69 @ASOS Isn’t that illegal? The discounted price has to reflect the price of the product over a set number of consecutive days prior to the discount being applied.
- @ASOS Have models in between a size 8 and plus size so you can get an idea of what it would look like on if you’re neither of these sizes
- These images still bang severely tbh. Wanted to do something a bit editorial and that.   I think we did a good job @AlbertineSarah !  Everything here is from @ASOS
- Buying some camp wears from @ASOS and I came across this pic. Gotta say I’m so glad to see they haven’t tried to airbrush out the marks on this gorgeous girl! Great to see fashion on normal girls who are allowed to be unashamedly beautiful marks or no marks! GOOD ON YOU ASOS!!

- Buying and selling fur is wrong. That’s why some of the largest clothing companies in the world  like @ASOS  @hm  &amp; @CalvinKlein have banned it.   So why does @backcountry continue to sell a product made from pain &amp; suffering?
- So much stuff on @ASOS I wanna buy 😥

- @stevebartlettsc @WiktoriaRyczko_ @ASOS @FashionNova @OfficialPLT if you’re concerned about this I’d encourage you to probably also consider these people (80% are 18-24yo women just like you but without the privilege)  rather than just being worried when it effects u and when you can’t see it 1st hand. We know the truth &amp; it’s worse than lead

- You know what I want from @ASOS? I want us to be able to use fit info across gendered sizing to identify what will fit.  i.e. if I shop in the men's section  I want to be like "in women's I wear size __" and get a rec via fit finder.
- Just some of the dangerous messages that @ASOS has posted in the last few days. Encouraging people to shop until they’re skint isn’t “relatable AF” or cute  it’s irresponsible.

- I can’t lie  the @asos x Beauty Awards catering squad leaving me a whole table worth of left over dinner (cuz they knew it clashed w my stage time) was as much of a highlight 4 me as my actual performance lol  Musta known how hungry I was 😂❤️ For real tho  ty for having me guys!

- Hey @asos you really shouldn't be listing suede under 'non leather' options for footwear  what with it being leather and all.
- I can’t wait for the @ASOS X @asda collab! Gonna be fire 🔥
- Jacket @Bershka  Shirt @ZARA  Skirt @ASOS
- Ovie 😎😆 @asos
- I am absolutely IN LOVE with this #StarWars dress from @ASOS! I wasn't sure if I'd like it - the pictures on the site don't do it justice! It has so many intricate hidden designs woven in. It is truly a work of art and I can't wait to wear it 💕
- @beckybootsxx @Missboredom98 @vsatkins @bonitasaph @ASOS @OfficialPLT_CS @isawitfirst_CS @NastyGal Nasty girl is always ‘50% off’ they’re somehow always in a sale - if there’s always a sale on it’s not a friggin sale  these companies don’t grasp that
- @ASOS x @PUMA ..May aswell add this in there x
- I’m an @ASOS slut
- I've been laid low at home for the past 3 days with a beastly cold/flu bug. But I can't possibly miss the @AdCouncil #AdCouncilDinner at @NYHiltonMidtown tonight. At #theskyapartment dosing myself with cold medication and breaking out the @zara red sequinned pantsuit 😊

- Wish @ASOS would slide in my dms with a treat 😫I guessed the magic eyes challenge &amp; even wrote them a poem 😭
- @vsatkins @Jade__04 @ASOS So interestingly I believe this is against the rules.   I believe a price must be in place for a specific period of time before a discount/sale can be applied and it must come from the last price listed.   So yeah  this is not keeping in line with the rules.
- @ASOS Hahahaha thanks - any chance of a DM drop for my troubles? 😅🙈
- My love language is buying things from @ASOS that I don’t remember actually buying and then being pleasantly surprised when they arrive

- @ASOS HAPPY BLACK FRIDAY #ASOSBlackFriday
- @ASOS I like big deals and I cannot lie #ASOSBlackFriday
- I swear @ASOS like to piss me off. I buy shit loads of stuff and 2 days later they throw a massive sale and pretty much everything I buy is discounted. Every time. CBA 😭
- NEW POST: Just woken up from a shitty nights sleep? I feel your pain. I’ve tested a sleep mist this month to find out if they reaaaally work. Take a read here:
- @ASOS Make beans on toast
- Saddest @ASOS story - Out of stock 😭
- @ASOS Literally everybody ya tight bastards
- Hate it when you really want a top and you got no money and it’s such a good deal on #BlackFriday @ASOS too 😢
- I would like to thank @ASOS for having a tall selection because for the first time in my life I found a long sleeve that covers my arms AND torso 😭
- @flowergirl_lon @ASOS I’d pretty much stopped wearing them because to get a proper fit on my legs I’d end up with welts where they’d dig in on my waist. Legit cannot recommend the MAT ones enough  I’ll never buy ‘normal’ jeans again.
- When you get drunk and buy everything in your saved @ASOS 😂
- What kind of t-shirt is this? 🤔 Really @ASOS? 😂😭
- 🔥SUPER EXCITING NEWS: We’ve been nominated for not one  but TWO @ASOS Beauty Awards! So we need YOU 😜💕 Head over to
- @iTayTill @ASOS Historically  red and pink were worn by boys and men - not females.
- @ASOS Gregg's festive bake. Not a sandwich but totally acceptable in any circumstance 😂👏

- Massive shoutout to @ASOS for seriously making my Thursday! Now I just need to scroll through the hundreds of saved items and work out what I’m going to buy!!! Thank you for my treat 🤩 #ASOSBlackFriday #NeverWinAnything ✨

- I'll always be a high street fashion kinda gal 💜 💜 Maxi dress @ASOS @monkiworld 💜 Embellished Beige sandals @Primark 💜 Earrings @ZARA  #outfitoftheday #ootd #style #highstreetfashion #LondonFashion #browngirl
- @fuckh33zy @ASOS Incredible purchases. Sometimes mental illness buys the best shit
- @amandajhelling @ASOS I do the same for running shoes. The women's shoes look so much better. Like  I know the fit is the same and it's just a change numerically in size  so I can see how much more frustrating it would be going between non-standard sizes.   Short version: great idea  I support it/you
- @ASOS Me and @EmilyJones56 please
- @ASOS HAPPY BLACK FRIDAY 🖤🤍
- @ASOS @RhianClare @FionaMcHrdy always needing ASOS vouchers 😭
- @viccocks97 @ASOS Omg love you so much! My bestie🧡 thank you xxxxx
- @stylsmile_uk @Lord_Sugar @ASOS @Argos_Online Its my 15yr wedding anniversary next week and I was going to book my wife in for anal bleaching at Dr Leah’s clinic but will this do the trick? If she sticks it up her arse for a few hours I’m guessing it will have the same effect &amp; probably at half the cost? Let me know ASAP.
- @ASOS Thank uuuuuuu so much omg😭
- @ASOS free voucher???
- Today I spent 20 minutes trying to sew a button on a dress only to have the zipper be so shitty I had to cut myself out of it. Moral of the story. Do not buy cheap dresses and fool yourself into thinking they'll be good quality. Lookin' at you @ASOS.
- The item I would love from @ASOS  the most is a set of Calvin Klein underwear because I’m running out and I’m currently commando because the others are either ripped or in the wash!!!  #helpme #ASOSBlackFriday

- .@ASOS has appointed Robert Birge as its first Chief Growth Officer #asos #ecommerce #onlineshopping #pureplays
- Despite offering up to 70% off selected lines  @ASOS is only discounting 10% off much of its New In page. Considering this is equal to its year round student discount  I'm not convinced this will entice shoppers to spend more this Black Friday
- Really @Topshop REALLY? How many times do I need to repeatedly complain about the packaging you send jewellery in? Sending me broken earrings with the backs all bent as you think it's good package them like this? Take note from @ASOS who put all jewellery in cardboard boxes!!

- @LOV3JONES31 @ASOS Loloool I tried it on and was totally perplexed like “why tf is this so big?!! I’m too small for a 0 now? Am I losing THAT much weight?! This is getting ridiculous!!” I tried to tie it and cinch it 599 different ways😂
- @sull_beau @ASOS Omg don’t  Klarna is the worst thing that ever happened to me 😂😂😂

- i love flowers.
- I love live music, that's why I try to go to concerts
- I do too. Wat do you like?
- I like acting, I hope to be an actor, what about you?
- that is ok.  have any kids?
- No, but someday.
- I heard Mount Tom Ski Area in Holyoke, Mass is a great resort to visit
- After I am done with school I plan to have a family.
- that is great! you will be ready
- I hope so, how old are your kids?
- i was once offered to play basketball professionally.
- I would imagine. I am sure they a great kids.
- luckily, they love flowers just as much as I do.  we spend a lot of time in the garden
- I wish I had more time to do stuff like that. Medical school is exhausting.
- sounds like it. have you gotten any acting jobs, though?
- i just bought a new house with my partner.
- i like to make my own coffee.
- Oh, I love lasagne. I make my own noodles as well as the sauce.
- Wow.  That's amazing.  I read where lasagne originated in Italy during the Middle Ages.
- Oh really!? That is interesting. I am actually italian myself.
- Awesome. Me and my partner just bought a house. I can't wait to cook in my kitchen.
- Moving in a new place can be a lot of fun. Are you a good cook?
- I like to think so. I love to make coffee for an after dinner treat too.
- Mmm That sounds delicious right now.
- What do you like to do?
- Well I like tattoos and piercings, I am working on my next one right now.
- piercings are cool . i do not have any tattoos though. Too scared. I want some
- What would you get?
- Maybe something for my kids. I've always wanted an anarchy symbol.
- Haha that is a cool idea.
- I like to think I'm cool too. Hopefully one day.
- my parents were divorced.
- i'm a widow.
- If you have patience teaching is great but they test your nerves every day
- My neighbors dog won't stop barking at me. Ugh!
- Thats the worst, is it a big dog or little dog?
- It's a little dog. Why is it the little ones always bark the most?
- I believe it is due to their behavior and internal and external stimuli.
- I'd like to introduce that dog to my pet snakes. I think they'd eat him though!
- Oh no! But I think black snakes are good? They eat nasty bugs and rodents!
- My snakes are both pythons. I feed them mice. Do you have any pets?
- No, but I would love to have a cat for it to hunt mice in my house lol
- You have mice running around your house? Yikes! I think I'd rather have the barking dogs than that.
- Lol, but they do make great companions at times.I give them bread and they leave me alone for the most part.
- Have you given them names? If not, maybe we can come up with some.
- i just called them all Jerry, Big Jerry, Always hungry Jerry and then there's the Tiny Jerry.
- Now you really do need to get a cat and call him Tom.
- Yep that would completely the collection! I am widow so I need all the companions I can get haha
- i have blue eyes and curly brown hair.
- i love to snack between meals.
- I took the train to work the other day and it was so crowded. I was feeling really claustrophobic.
- I would have been too! Do you always take it to work?
- yes i do because i do not have a car
- if you could have a car what would it be?
- a honda because they are affordable and reliable
- i love the oscar mier wiener-mobile. it reminds me of snacking when i'm not having a meal. would you drive the oscar meir weiner mobile?
- i do not think so, what about you?
- i lost my driver's liscense, ufortunately, but i would if i could
- how did you lose it?
- i did some bad stuff, but that's not important
- im saving up to buy a new camera to take pictures of people who lost their licenses actually
- do you take pictures of people with curly hair like mine?
- no, only people with long hair like mine
- well, you got to do you, brother. i'm proud of you anyway!
- i always answer my cellphone.
- i work in sales.
- that is good . i'm nursing a cold and vitamin c does nothing lol
- oh sorry about that . taking lots of fluids ?
- Yes, thank you. I think I just need some time to make it pass.
- Should always be drinking water anyways, your body needs it!
- Yes it does, especially during summer.
- What do you do for a living?  I try my best in sales.
- I work at a ski resort. I love it!
- I have never been but I have heard the same. I love snow and the mountains.
- I wish I could enjoy the snow and mountains, I would be afraid I could not answer my cellphone!
- Haha, these days it is amazing where you can get cell service.
- i agree ! that is the main reason I have a phone !
- Do you have any plans this weekend?
- No plans yet, I'm just happy to sleep in for once!
- i love to go out to eat with my family.
- i like to go to the movies.
- that is good. I have 2
- He's a good worker but not as reliable as I am. He is always calling in or not putting much effort into his work. I feel I should have gotten that position.
- That's a shame, if that's the case then I agree.
- Yea, but to be perfectly honest, I actually don't work hard either.
- oh i see . i am really reliable in my job on other things i am not
- Well my problem is that I just never had to really work. I always had money. What things are you not reliable in?
- Mostly jobs and children.
- What do you mean children?
- 5 & 7.  they take up a lot of my time
- They are food, shelter, child care, health care, transportation, and utilities.
- Ok, Im pretty confused as to what you mean, but that sounds like a lot.
- it is a lot to take care of because kids are a lot of responsibility
- I see. Well good luck with that, I wouldn't know because I don't have kids yet.
- oh well thank you . what else should i know about you ?
- Well, Im going through some drama right now with my sister in law, she hates me.
- Family conflict is always hard.  Maybe you should be the bigger man and work for peace
- i work as a teacher and love my job.
- i've two dogs who are like my babies.
- My boss earns way more money than me for less work.
- That must be so annoying. You should ask for a pay raise.
- yeah, i think i will!
- Lasagne
- I love my job as a teacher but would also like to assk for a raise
- who do you ask? aren't teacher salaries decided by some sort of... thing, or whatever? i love my family.
- I would ask the school board they base it on how long you've been there and test scores
- how would the principal feel about you going behind his back?
- Not sure, I suppose I could sit down and discuss it with him. What kind of work do you do?
- i'm a garbage man, although i'm a woman. my boss drives the truck, but i'm more qualified, really.
- I've never driven a truck, only small vehicles! How's that working out for you? My two dogs would love to ride along if I did that
- dogs would for sure love a big truck full of garbage. i thik i'm the top 20 or so best garbage men in the area
- oh wow that is impressive . must be an extremely difficult job .
- no.literally anyone could do it. you just pick up garbage. it's not as easy as teaching, im sure, buts ittakes no skill
- i have woman calling me all the time.
- I got really joyful when my dad got me my first vehicle. It was just a happy feeling
- Yeah. I know that feeling., although I had to buy my own.
- The vehicle was exactly what I wanted, a newer model sports car.
- That was a good choice, What kind of car was it?
- A Mustang GT, convertible
- Nice! Too bad you couldn't get  your hands on a 1963 Mustang II. That's my favorite car.
- A few years ago I helped with a restoration on a 67. It was absolutely gorgeous.
- That sounds awesome. Did you restore it with your dad?
- dancing is my passion.
- i'm terrible at math.
- Dance
- I enjoy dance a lot as well, my daughter does tap dancing. What kind of dancing do you like most?
- I don't have a particular favorite style, but I've always thought tap was the odd one, even though you see it all the time on Broadway.
- Tap is pretty odd compared to the others. My daughter loves ballet.
- i love broadway shows , so this was the closest thing i had .
- Yea, well keep it up, maybe one day you'll be on broadway.
- i hope so. i'm so bad at math. they count 5,6,7,8! at the beginning, and i wish they would stick to smaller numbers
- hahah that's funny. I believe in you though, you can overcome that.
- it's like a chorus line. the musical with actor michael douglass. have you seen it/
- No I haven't, I don't watch movies very often. Im usually out at clubs people watching.
- when do you think you'll get a chance to catch up on some film? I love dancing, but when I'm not treading the boards, I love watching tv
- Probably not for a while. I just bought a new jaguar and I try to get out and just drive around and show it off as much as possible.
- wow, i love animals. What does it eat?
- Haha the car not the animal. A jaguar would eat me as I tried to feed it for sure.
- do you hink people like looking at you r car? I heard they are hard to maintain
- i'm a reality tv star.
- i listen to country music.
- i wish i was there
- i saw lots of animals . reminded me of when i worked for a circus .
- You worked for a circus? Tell me you juggled while riding a unicycle and had a monkey on your shoulder.
- No, I couldn't do that.
- Me neither, but that might be because I like to drink...a lot.
- I drink a lot too because I am a reality tv star and it is stressful
- Are you famous? I'm kind of famous in my own town.
- yes, i am famous. what type of music do you listen to?
- My favorite singer is Meatloaf, are you a fan of his?
- never heard of him, i only listen to country music honestly
- Not only is Meatloaf a great singer, but it's also a delicious food. Can't beat that combo.
- Food is the gateway to the soul.
- And meatloaf is the express train to my heart. Nothing like a little hamburg and spices to get things going.
- that sounds delicious
- i've a masters degree in creative writing.
- i live in a medium sized city.
- I recently got a $50 gift card that I'm really looking forward to using.
- That's awesome. I'd be excited too. What are you going to get with it?
- I think I am going to get a new camera.
- what happened to your old one?
- Nothing but I want an upgrade.
- why can't you just use the one on your phone?
- I am trying to do professional photography.
- Wow. I love writing fiction creatively, and that would make a great story. What sort of phone did you start out with?
- You know just a flip phone haha. Are you working on a book right now?
- It's about these pills that reveal the world is full of dinosaurs, but you can't ee them without the pills, so you don't know where they are
- Oh! Interesting! That would be scary.
- it's a drama, actually, and the dinosaurs don;t bother anyone. would you ever take a picture of something like that?
- Of course! That would make my career!
- oh cool. what sort of shutter speed would u set it on?
- i like lightning mcqueen.
- i have a cat named mater.
- Roommate just walked in on me while I was... trying to... "feel good" if you know what I mean. So awkward. My door doesn't have a lock, either. I told him to not come in, and he just kept coming in!
- I not sure what do you mean, but can use my imagination,  it sounds like something really embarrassing.
- It was. I don't know why I didn't just stop doing it.
- Probably a good idea . Now i'm not sure what to say . An awkward ordeal.
- Neither am I. I'm not even sure why I brought up such a thing in a random conversation.
- Try not to let it get to you.  Life is weird. Things happen and then you move on.
- Amen to that. Anyway, do you like to read?
- I do like reading. Lately I've been reading about Lightning McQueen. Do you like the movie "Cars"?
- Is that the animated movie?
- Yeah they have made a few of them. I like them so much I named my cat mater after the tow truck in the film.
- Oh thats really cool. Yea I love those movies a lot! Whats your favorite food?
- I love chicken, and Chinese food. Well, just about any food actually. How about you?
- I love pizza, its definitely my favorite of all time. Chinese is great too though. Have you had chinese pizza before?
- Yes! The Chinese restaurant down the street has it. It's pretty good.
- i'm unsociable.
- my weakness are sweets.
- that isn't bad either
- i find that i'm not a sociable person
- that is okay, everyone is different
- yeah I'm pretty different if you get what I mean
- no i do not get what you mean, care to elaborate?
- well we have  sub personality that tends to control or feelings
- i think the crystals i dabble with can change your sub personality
- oh wow I hear that stuff is bad for you
- im addicted to the power of them
- I really can't stop eating sweets myself
- you will stop when you get diabetes
- Yeah I was told the same thing, but I'm addicted. unlucky
- meditation will dissolve all addictions
- I will try medicine first
- i played football in college.
- i work at a candy store.
- oh ok . that makes more sense now .
- i am watching football on tv today . do you like to watch sports too ?
- I do. I love watching football with my dog. Do you have any pets?
- i have a cat, what do you do as a job?
- I'm a student, which is great for now. Gives me time to hang out with my friends. What do you do?
- im currently working at a candy store
- That sounds awesome!
- did you ever play sports in school?
- Nah. Never had the discipline. I'd always rather be with my friends.
- i played football and basketball in college and i wouldnt trade that experience for the world
- What did you study in college?
- Criminology, what about you?
- Currently political science, but I'm thinking about switching.
- what are you thinking of switching to?
- my eyes are bright blue.
- i do not have a college degree.
- I am going on a flight for the first time in a couple weeks. I am really scared for some reason!
- Good for you. Is it truly your first time flying on a plane?
- Yea, I have a really bad feeling that its going to crash or something.
- oh. my god. i never fiinished college, so i'm willing to listen to you explain your psychic visions to me
- Ok well, I had a vision last night that aliens would attack my plane and we would crash.
- we're on the same plane? what country are these illegals from? like hijackers?
- No why would you be on my flight a couple weeks from now? They are from another planet, most likely Jupiter.
- sounds like i'd be better off just cancelling our trip and going back to finish my degree. what do you think?
- Would you? I think that is for the best. It's safer.
- do you have to take off your shoes at airports still? I know like in japan you probably do, but is it everywhere?
- I think so, what Im not sure about though is if they every give them back to you. I think they might just mail them to you
- yeah, there's a fed ex in there for that. Where are you going on your trip?
- I am going to Japan actually but then Im flying right back. I'm really just going for the flying experience.
- Smart. You don't want your airline miles to expire. Are you getting a meal? Maybe a hot towl?
- i live in springfield , mo.
- i just bought my first home.
- that's my favorite ! oh , ribs are the best . have to be careful though !
- true . have you ever won any challenges ?
- No, I am worried about the calorie intake, haha.
- no , i love a challenge . i want to eat it all .
- I can agree with that. Have you heard the news recently?
- No. I have not turned on the tv
- There is new footage of an alien ship plying over the ocean.
- wow that would be exciting and scary .
- I always knew they watched over us.
- Something like the Aliens in the film franchise?
- Yes it is shocking to watch.
- yea i have seen some interesting things .
- Tell me! I am always interested in UFO stories.
- Aliens came out 1986.
- i have a beta fish.
- i'm a poet.
- Betta
- I used to have a Betta fish!  It lived for a long time.
- Oh, yes, they can live very long, although they are a species of small fishes!
- I have two dogs. One named Bruno and the other named Mars, because I like Bruno Mars, lol.
- That's cute. I love the cute name. I miss my dog.
- Aww, I'm sorry about your dog. What was your dog's name?
- Her name was frost, after robert frost
- That's awesome! I love Robert Frost's books. You must like to read, yes?
- i do , I am an aspiring poet.
- Great to hear. I hope to read your works someday! have you been published in anything yet?
- Yes a few things, they are doing well.
- That's good. I used to write some things when I was in school, but nothing serious. Always dreamed of getting a book published, though.
- I am sure if you kept at it you would be very successful.
- Maybe one day I'll start again. I work too much right now and don't have a whole lot of time to devote to it.
- I'm sure you will one day! What do you do?
- my favorite color is orange.
- i enjoy swimming.
- its not too bad , get a lot of kissed by fire comments nowadays . they are okay !

- Sounds like good memories
- yes , i sure do remember those days and how much fun we all had ! !
- My hair was so red back then
- is red your favorite color?
- its alright as long it is bright red
- i think my favorite color is orange because it can turn into any shade of red or range i find
- I like the color of yellow reminds me of corn on the farm
- is corn one of your favorite foods?
- i love to snack between meals.
- i've blue eyes and curly brown hair.
- that is such a great idea i should do that with my siblings
- it really alot of fun .
- What kind of positives do you get out of that?
- We don't have a lot of photos together. We all have the same curly brown hair.
- That's pretty neat. It must be hard to take care of curly hair.
- Its a long process but I love it
- I have had a dog that had curly hair. It was a mixed poodle and it was red. Really active animal she was.
- My aunt had a poodle greyhound mix. She was gorgeous
- That mix of dog breeds sounds cool. Was she tall like the greyhound or short like the poodle? You get all kinds of unique traits
- Tall and pretty grey coat
- Beautiful type of dog. We had one growing up as a kid. Hard to keep him contained
- I loved that dog and I'm a cat person.
- I feel you. Cats are sometimes easier to have around. We have four of them now haha.
- Cool. We are going to adopt when we move soon.
- i'm a vegetarian.
- i like to make cakes.
- do you want to sing in the church choir ?

- Any kind of pasta, it's my weakness.
- I love pasta
- I do too.  I have a fantastic recipe with alfredo sauce.
- alfredo is the best do you make it from scratch?
- Yes, everything from scratch. It is an old recipe.
- my favorite movie is dirty harry.
- i collect stamps.
- Dirty Harry
- I do but Dirty Harry is my all time favorite
- I liked that it drew upon the actual case of the Zodiac Killer. It made the movie so interesting.
- Me too, serial killers are dark but fascinating people.
- You seem to know a lot about serial killers!
- Well, I think it's important to learn about human nature in all forms, don't you? It's how we evolve.
- Absolutely, although I find them too scary. I prefer to stick to collecting stamps.
- Haha yea, I understand that. I am actually a writer so I have to do a lot of research on such things unfortunately
- Ah, yes, the lucrative writing career. (Just kidding), What types of stuff do you write?
- Haha well, passion is passion, money or not. I write horror and mystery novels mostly. Do you enjoy reading?
- i do , i love to read dean koontz. He's my favorite.
- Yes I love koontz as well, He was a big inspiration for me growing up
- That's very cool. What other authors inspired you?
- Stephen King, etc. Mostly horror authors. Do you have any hobbies?
- Other than collecting stamps, I play a lot of tennis. How about you?
- i want to learn self defense.
- i want to move to las vegas.
- Was playing rough with my relatives, running around outside, doing touch football. I think I twisted my ankle or something. I'm dumb and don't have health insurance this year.. Worried how much money I'm gonna have to spend
- Hopefully it is just a sprain. Might not need to receive medical attention.
- It hurts badly so I am afraid I may have to see a doctor.
- Yeah, maybe you should just put some ice on it? It's supposed to be ice on and off for 10 min intervels.We learned that in self defense class.
- Oh that is a good idea, I will be taking your advice. but what if that does not work?
- Could look into doctors in your area that take self pay, some help with making payments and some have programs for uninsured.
- In today's world no one will take pity on me. The pain is excruciating. I think I need pain killers too
- Seriously, I'm also uninsured, wanted to move to Vegas but the rates there for healthcare were worse than my place, I'm sorry
- I am so sorry to hear that you are in the same boat as me. We really need insurance.
- Would be nice for sure, but not too much we can do I guess, besides the injury anything good happen recently?
- Well My mate proposed to me yesterday, I am so happy
- Oh wow that's awesome to hear! A big congrats to the both of you!
- Thanks a lot. we would like to have five children.
- Wow, five now that's going to be a fun family, my wife and I are thinking of adopting ourselves.
- i'm a girl who loves sports cars and video games.
- i like swimming.
- Backstroke
- I like to swim. I don't do it much but I like it. Have never tried the backstroke style. Is it hard?
- It is not hard. especially those who fear not being able to breath, backstroke is the best
- It sounds like good exercise
- It is. I have gotten in much better shape since I started. Counteracts all of the video games I play, lol. Do you like video games?
- Yes, i play a lot. Probably too much.
- As long as you get up every now and then to stretch you're alright, lol. I love racing games the most.
- I like RPG. Something to make me feel less lonely.
- I like those games too! Sometimes I like to just go off and pretend I am someone else and have fun in those games.
- Exactly! The games today are amazing!
- They really are. It's amazing how far the games have come since back in the day. i still like classic games, too.
- Same here, sometimes I play mario kart.
- Mario Kart was a great game! I was so good at dropping those bananas! Nintendo has become one of the most influential video game companies in the industry!
- It really has. The CEO seems like a good person.
- Yeah, they really seem to care about the games they put out.
- i live alone in a cabin.
- i like to go fishing on the lake.
- Golf
- Yah, but I hate it when I wack a ball into a pond.
- yes me too!  on a course there are holes to hit the ball in which is 4.25 inches in diameter.
- that is more than enough size for a hole, i should pay that course a visit
- oh, you simply must. It gets so lonely here, for me, in my isolated cabin.
- do you work?
- I'mnot sure. Maybe? I fish. I fish in the lake. Do you know it?
- no i do not have much time to fish at lakes because i am busy at the large law firm i work at
- I love law. I had jury duty once and the law seemed so official. I'm jealous.
- what are you jealous of?

- That is too bad, yes this has gotten me depressed a lot for sure.
- Man I'm so sorry. My mom works for Apple maybe I can ask if she knows of any way to get a job there for you.

- Holy moly, that's some rough luck. Did you find the guy who did it?
- Oh no I reported it to the police but so far they have not found the person who did it
- sounds like you need to take matters into your own hands. The police can't help you. Not when real justice is required.
- I honestly don't know how to go about doing it.
- Close your eyes and let your fantasies guide you. You know what you want deep down inside
- Well, even though I am a jack of all trades I do need some tires. I am so upset
- I thik you're a great person, but you need to stand up for yourself. I have a small dog. It helps me.

- Well, I don't have one yet, but it will be a programming company
- Oh! Well it involves several fields of electrical engineering and computer science to develop software.
- Sounds like I will have to hire some smart people.
- Everyone needs an IT guy, so probably best to get good developers.
- How much does it cost to pay for an IT guy?
- it depends on the specific technologies you are looking for. somewhere between $55-70 an hour is standard.
- Oh wow, that's a lot. Maybe I can get a new grad that is cheaper.
- this depends on the level of experience that your project requires. also the maturity level you are seeking in an employee.
- That's true. This is more complicated than I was expecting.
- Well, hopefully when it's all said and done it'll be be worth it. Best of luck with it.

- i m very religious.
- Religion
- Maybe it's the way organized religion works.  Many people paying attention to one person in a room, which means that all too often people think of whatever they want to!  At least that is my experience.
- If you try to look at it from the psychological perspective, religious and nonreligious people are nearly identical. Religious people simply think there's greater meaning behind their actions.
- That is pretty to take in all once can you explain
- People all act the same way, some people just think their actions are more meaningful
- Interesting, but some actions are more meaningful, like I am a vegan
- Why did you become vegan?
- mainly because I wanted to change the world and save animals
- How do you think that will change the world?
- Because I looked in a cows eyes and they were the same color brown as my own
- Do you think cows have feelings?
- Well it felt like I was looking into the mirror of my own soul and emotions
- That's sad. Do you think the cow feels the same about being vegan?
- That is why they mainly eat grass and things because they are just like me

- That's pretty lucky, did you spend it?
- Not yet. What do you think I should buy with it?
- I think you should try to find the owner and give it back
- How do I know I'm not the owner? Maybe I dropped it yesterday?
- Well, if that's the case that's cool. Did you lose $20 yesterday?
- No. Wow. There goes that theory. Who do you think dropped it?
- I think it was me. Can you bring it to me?
- That depends. Do you like hockey?
- Which answer will get the $20?
- Hey, I think you're just trying to tell me what I want to hear. You're not tricking me, are you?
- Definitely not, I just want my $20 back.
