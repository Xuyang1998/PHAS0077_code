Well good luck with that, I wouldn't know because I don't have kids yet.oh well thank you . what else should i know about you ?Well, Im going through some drama right now with my sister in law, she hates me.Family conflict is always hard.

You should ask for a pay raise.yeah, i think i will!I love my job as a teacher but would also like to assk for a raisewho do you ask? aren't teacher salaries decided by some sort of... thing, or whatever? i love my family.I would ask the school board they base it on how long you've been there and test scoreshow would the principal feel about you going behind his back?Not sure, I suppose I could sit down and discuss it with him.

But that's OK. BBQ rules.i just took a trip to london.i m very religious.Maybe it's the way organized religion works.  Many people paying attention to one person in a room, which means that all too often people think of whatever they want to!  At least that is my experience.If you try to look at it from the psychological perspective, religious and nonreligious people are nearly identical. Religious people simply think there's greater meaning behind their actions.That is pretty to take in all once can you explainPeople all act the same way, some people just think their actions are more meaningfulInteresting, but some actions are more meaningful, like I am a veganWhy did you become vegan?mainly because I wanted to change the world and save animalsHow do you think that will change the world?Because I looked in a cows eyes and they were the same color brown as my ownDo you think cows have feelings?Well it felt like I was looking into the mirror of my own soul and emotionsThat's sad. Do you think the cow feels the same about being vegan?That is why they mainly eat grass and things because they are just like meI think they just eat grass because they're too slow to catch an animali paint in my free time.i live in vienna , austria now.It is, it is pretty incredible that we are capable of reading and writing.Yes both, including reading is a great means of language.I also love to readI do also paint in my free time,How old are youI'm gonna be 23 this year and living in Vienna, Austriamy favorite drink is red wine.i work for a clothes retailer.I can't believe I found a 20 dollar bill outside my house. It was not expected at all.That's pretty lucky, did you spend it?Not yet. What do you think I should buy with it?I think you should try to find the owner and give it backHow do I know I'm not the owner? Maybe I dropped it yesterday?Well, if that's the case that's cool. Did you lose $20 yesterday?No. Wow. There goes that theory. Who do you think dropped it?I think it was me. Can you bring it to me?That depends. Do you like hockey?Which answer will get the $20?Hey, I think you're just trying to tell me what I want to hear.

Should always be drinking water anyways, your body needs it! Yes it does, especially during summer. What do you do for a living?  I try my best in sales. I work at a ski resort. I love it! I have never been but I have heard the same. I love snow and the mountains. I wish I could enjoy the snow and mountains, I would be afraid I could not answer my cellphone! Haha, these days it is amazing where you can get cell service. i agree ! that is the main reason I have a phone ! Do you have any plans this weekend? No plans yet, I'm just happy to sq2jup in for once! i love to go out to eat with my family. i like to go to the movies. that is good. I have 2 He's a good worker but not as reliable as I am. He is always calling in or not putting much effort into his work. I feel I should have gotten that position. That's a shame, if that's the case then I agree. Yea, but to be perfectly honest, I actually don't work hard either. oh i see . i am really reliable in my job on other things i am not Well my problem is that I just never had to really work. I always had money. What things are you not reliable in? Mostly jobs and children. What do you mean children? 5 & 7.  they take up a lot of my time They are food, shelter, child care, health care, transportation, and utilities. Ok, Im pretty confused as to what you mean, but that sounds like a lot. it is a lot to take care of because kids are a lot of responsibility I see. Well good luck with that, I wouldn't know because I don't have kids yet. oh well thank you . what else should i know about you ? Well, Im going through some drama right now with my sister in law, she hates me. Family conflict is always hard.  Maybe you should be the bigger man and work for peace i work as a teacher and love my job. i've two dogs who are like my babies. My boss earns way more money than me for less work. That must be so annoying. You should ask for a pay raise. yeah, i think i will! I love my job as a teacher but would also like to assk for a raise who do you ask? aren't teacher salaries decided by some sort of... thing, or whatever? i love my family. I would ask the school board they base it on how long you've been there and test scores how would the principal feel about you going behind his back? Not sure, I suppose I could sit down and discuss it with him. What kind of work do you do? i'm a garbage man, although i'm a woman. my boss drives the truck, but i'm more qualified, really. I've never driven a truck, only small vehicles! How's that working out for you? My two dogs would love to ride along if I did that dogs would for sure love a big truck full of garbage. i thik i'm the top 20 or so best garbage men in the area oh wow that is impressive . must be an extremely difficult job . no.literally anyone could do it. you just pick up garbage. it's not as easy as teaching, im sure, buts ittakes no skill i have woman calling me all the time. I got really joyful when my dad got me my first vehicle. It was just a happy feeling Yeah. I know that feeling., although I had to buy my own. The vehicle was exactly what I wanted, a newer model sports car. That was a good choice, What kind of car was it? A Mustang GT, convertible Nice! Too bad you couldn't get  your hands on a 1963 Mustang II. That's my favorite car. A few years ago I helped with a restoration on a 67. It was absolutely gorgeous. That sounds awesome. Did you restore it with your dad? dancing is my passion. i'm terrible at math. I enjoy dance a lot as well, my daughter does tap dancing. What kind of dancing do you like most? I don't have a particular favorite style, but I've always thought tap was the odd one, even though you see it all the time on Broadway. Tap is pretty odd compared to the others. My daughter loves ballet. i love broadway shows , so this was the closest thing i had . Yea, well keep it up, maybe one day you'll be on broadway. i hope so. i'm so bad at math. they count 5,6,7,8! at the beginning, and i wish they would stick to smaller numbers hahah that's funny. I believe in you though, you can overcome that. it's like a chorus line. the musical with actor michael douglass. have you seen it/ No I haven't, I don't watch movies very often. Im usually out at clubs people watching. when do you think you'll get a chance to catch up on some film? I love dancing, but when I'm not treading the boards, I love watching tv Probably not for a while. I just bought a new jaguar and I try to get out and just drive around and show it off as much as possible. wow, i love animals. What does it eat? Haha the car not the animal. A jaguar would eat me as I tried to feed it for sure. do you hink people like looking at you r car? I heard they are hard to maintain i'm a reality tv star. i listen to country music. i wish i was there i saw lots of animals . reminded me of when i worked for a circus . You worked for a circus? Tell me you jo6r1humled while riding a unicycle and had a monkey on your shoulder. No, I couldn't do that. Me neither, but that might be because I like to drink...a lot. I drink a lot too because I am a reality tv star and it is stressful Are you famous? I'm kind of famous in my own town. yes, i am famous. what type of music do you listen to? My favorite singer is Meatloaf, are you a fan of his? never heard of him, i only listen to country music honestly Not only is Meatloaf a great singer, but it's also a delicious food. Can't beat that combo. Food is the gateway to the soul. And meatloaf is the express train to my heart. Nothing like a little hamburg and spices to get things going. that sounds delicious i've a masters degree in creative writing. i live in a medium sized city. I recently got a $50 gift card that I'm really looking forward to using. That's awesome. I'd be excited too. What are you going to get with it? I think I am going to get a new camera. what happened to your old one? Nothing but I want an upgrade. why can't you just use the one on your phone? I am trying to do professional photography. Wow. I love writing fiction creatively, and that would make a great story. What sort of phone did you start out with? You know just a flip phone haha. Are you working on a book right now? It's about these pills that reveal the world is full of dinosaurs, but you can't ee them without the pills, so you don't know where they are Oh! Interesting! That would be scary. it's a drama, actually, and the dinosaurs don;t bother anyone. would you ever take a picture of something like that? Of course! That would make my career! oh cool. what sort of shutter speed would u set it on? i like lightning mcqueen. i have a cat named mater. Roommate just walked in on me while I was... trying to... \"feel good\" if you know what I mean. So awkward. My door doesn't have a lock, either. I told him to not come in, and he just kept coming in! I not sure what do you mean, but can use my imagination,  it sounds like something really embarrassing. It was. I don't know why I didn't just stop doing it. Probably a good idea . Now i'm not sure what to say . An awkward ordeal. Neither am I. I'm not even sure why I brought up such a thing in a random conversation. Try not to let it get to you.  Life is weird. Things happen and then you move on. Amen to that. Anyway, do you like to read? I do like reading. Lately I've been reading about Lightning McQueen. Do you like the movie \"Cars\"? Is that the animated movie? Yeah they have made a few of them. I like them so much I named my cat mater after the tow truck in the film. Oh thats really cool. Yea I love those movies a lot! Whats your favorite food? I love chicken, and Chinese food. Well, just about any food actually. How about you? I love pizza, its definitely my favorite of all time. Chinese is great too though. Have you had chinese pizza before? Yes! The Chinese restaurant down the street has it. It's pretty good. my weakness are sweets. that isn't bad either i find that i'm not a sociable person that is okay, everyone is different yeah I'm pretty different if you get what I mean no i do not get what you mean, care to elaborate? well we have  sub personality that tends to control or feelings i think the crystals i dabble with can change your sub personality oh wow I hear that stuff is bad for you im addicted to the power of them I really can't stop eating sweets myself you will stop when you get diabetes Yeah I was told the same thing, but I'm addicted. unlucky meditation will dissolve all addictions I will try medicine first i played football in college. i work at a candy store. oh ok . that makes more sense now . i am watching football on tv today . do you like to watch sports too ? I do. I love watching football with my dog. Do you have any pets? i have a cat, what do you do as a job? I'm a student, which is great for now. Gives me time to hang out with my friends. What do you do? im currently working at a candy store That sounds awesome! did you ever play sports in school? Nah. Never had the discipline. I'd always rather be with my friends. i played football and basketball in college and i wouldnt trade that experience for the world What did you study in college? Criminology, what about you? Currently political science, but I'm thinking about switching. what are you thinking of switching to? my eyes are bright blue. i do not have a college degree. I am going on a flight for the first time in a couple weeks. I am really scared for some reason! Good for you. Is it truly your first time flying on a plane? Yea, I have a really bad feeling that its going to crash or something. oh. my god. i never fiinished college, so i'm willing to listen to you explain your psychic visions to me Ok well, I had a vision last night that aliens would attack my plane and we would crash. we're on the same plane? what country are these illegals from? like hijackers? No why would you be on my flight a couple weeks from now? They are from another planet, most likely Jupiter. sounds like i'd be better off just cancelling our trip and going back to finish my degree. what do you think? Would you? I think that is for the best. It's safer. do you have to take off your shoes at airports still? I know like in japan you probably do, but is it everywhere? I think so, what Im not sure about though is if they every give them back to you. I think they might just mail them to you yeah, there's a fed ex in there for that. Where are you going on your trip? I am going to Japan actually but then Im flying right back. I'm really just going for the flying experience. Smart. You don't want your airline miles to expire. Are you getting a meal? Maybe a hot towl? i live in springfield , mo. i just bought my first home. that's my favorite ! oh , ribs are the best . have to be careful though ! true . have you ever won any challenges ? No, I am worried about the calorie intake, haha. no , i love a challenge . i want to eat it all . I can agree with that. Have you heard the news recently? No. I have not turned on the tv There is new footage of an alien ship plying over the ocean. wow that would be exciting and scary . I always knew they watched over us. Something like the Aliens in the film franchise? Yes it is shocking to watch. yea i have seen some interesting things . Tell me! I am always interested in UFO stories. Aliens came out 1986. i have a beta fish. i'm a poet. I used to have a Betta fish!  It lived for a long time. Oh, yes, they can live very long, although they are a species of small fishes! I have two dogs. One named Bruno and the other named Mars, because I like Bruno Mars, lol. That's cute. I love the cute name. I miss my dog. Aww, I'm sorry about your dog. What was your dog's name? Her name was frost, after robert frost That's awesome! I love Robert Frost's books. You must like to read, yes? i do , I am an aspiring poet. Great to hear. I hope to read your works someday! have you been published in anything yet? Yes a few things, they are doing well. That's good. I used to write some things when I was in school, but nothing serious. Always dreamed of getting a book published, though. I am sure if you kept at it you would be very successful. Maybe one day I'll start again. I work too much right now and don't have a whole lot of time to devote to it. I'm sure you will one day! What do you do? my favorite color is orange. i enjoy swimming. its not too bad , get a lot of kissed by fire comments nowadays . they are okay ! i like the country more and swimming in the creeks . I like country too! country is quite popular in the southern part of the united states I was raised on a farm myself i use to swim in the lake behind my uncle's farm and had the time of my life Sounds like good memories yes , i sure do remember those days and how much fun we all had ! ! My hair was so red back then is red your favorite color? its alright as long it is bright red i think my favorite color is orange because it can turn into any shade of red or range i find I like the color of yellow reminds me of corn on the farm is corn one of your favorite foods? i love to snack between meals. i've blue eyes and curly brown hair. that is such a great idea i should do that with my siblings it really alot of fun . What kind of positives do you get out of that? We don't have a lot of photos together. We all have the same curly brown hair. That's pretty neat. It must be hard to take care of curly hair. Its a long process but I love it I have had a dog that had curly hair. It was a mixed poodle and it was red. Really active animal she was. My aunt had a poodle greyhound mix. She was gorgeous That mix of dog breeds sounds cool. Was she tall like the greyhound or short like the poodle? You get all kinds of unique traits Tall and pretty grey coat Beautiful type of dog.

I do but Dirty Harry is my all time favorite I liked that it drew upon the actual case of the Zodiac Killer. It made the movie so interesting. Me too, serial killers are dark but fascinating people. You seem to know a lot about serial killers! Well, I think it's important to learn about human nature in all forms, don't you? It's how we evolve. Absolutely, although I find them too scary. I prefer to stick to collecting stamps. Haha yea, I understand that. I am actually a writer so I have to do a lot of research on such things unfortunately Ah, yes, the lucrative writing career. (Just kidding), What types of stuff do you write? Haha well, passion is passion, money or not. I write horror and mystery novels mostly. Do you enjoy reading? i do , i love to read dean koontz.

Do you have any hobbies? Other than collecting stamps, I play a lot of tennis. How about you? i want to learn self defense. i want to move to las vegas. Was playing rough with my relatives, running around outside, doing touch football. I think I twisted my ankle or something. I'm dumb and don't have health insurance this year.. Worried how much money I'm gonna have to spend Hopefully it is just a sprain. Might not need to receive medical attention. It hurts badly so I am afraid I may have to see a doctor. Yeah, maybe you should just put some ice on it? It's supposed to be ice on and off for 10 min intervels.We learned that in self defense class. Oh that is a good idea, I will be taking your advice. but what if that does not work? Could look into doctors in your area that take self pay, some help with making payments and some have programs for uninsured. In today's world no one will take pity on me. The pain is excruciating. I think I need pain killers too Seriously, I'm also uninsured, wanted to move to Vegas but the rates there for healthcare were worse than my place, I'm sorry I am so sorry to hear that you are in the same boat as me. We really need insurance. Would be nice for sure, but not too much we can do I guess, besides the injury anything good happen recently? Well My mate proposed to me yesterday, I am so happy Oh wow that's awesome to hear! A big congrats to the both of you! Thanks a lot. we would like to have five children. Wow, five now that's going to be a fun family, my wife and I are thinking of adopting ourselves. i'm a girl who loves sports cars and video games. i like swimming. I like to swim. I don't do it much but I like it. Have never tried the backstroke style. Is it hard? It is not hard. especially those who fear not being able to breath, backstroke is the best It sounds like good exercise It is. I have gotten in much better shape since I started. Counteracts all of the video games I play, lol. Do you like video games? Yes, i play a lot. Probably too much. As long as you get up every now and then to stretch you're alright, lol. I love racing games the most. I like RPG. Something to make me feel less lonely. I like those games too! Sometimes I like to just go off and pretend I am someone else and have fun in those games. Exactly! The games today are amazing! They really are. It's amazing how far the games have come since back in the day. i still like classic games, too. Same here, sometimes I play mario kart. Mario Kart was a great game! I was so good at dropping those bananas! Nintendo has become one of the most influential video game companies in the industry! It really has. The CEO seems like a good person. Yeah, they really seem to care about the games they put out. i live alone in a cabin. i like to go fishing on the lake. Yah, but I hate it when I wack a ball into a pond. yes me too!  on a course there are holes to hit the ball in which is 4.25 inches in diameter. that is more than enough size for a hole, i should pay that course a visit oh, you simply must. It gets so lonely here, for me, in my isolated cabin. do you work? I'mnot sure. Maybe? I fish. I fish in the lake. Do you know it? no i do not have much time to fish at lakes because i am busy at the large law firm i work at I love law. I had jury duty once and the law seemed so official. I'm jealous. what are you jealous of? how you must interract with people. All the cool rules and the way you can approach the bench. law clerks, stenographers, it rules. you should try to get a job in law then If there was any law and order around the isolated cabin and the lake where I fish, I would get into it. ahh it sounds like you are really attached to your cabin Confined you might say. And the lake. I can never leave. I love the fishing. i like to go to comic con. my father recently had a heart attack. ok, so where was carrots first cultivated and harvested? It probably originated in Persia and was first cultivated for its leaves and seeds. But seeds have been found in Germany from 3000 BC Wow that really old. Maybe if my dad had eaten a lot of carrots like me he wouldn't have had a heart attack i don t believe in love. i am adopted. i was living in a storage locker for 2 month that's cool , are you married ? do you believe in love ? because i do not Wow. that's a lot. I do believe in love though. Yea I've been burned too many times. Have you been in love? I have. Sometimes it doesn't work but you have to keep trying I guess so. It just seems like so much pain to end up with nothing. I had to move into a storage locker after a break up. Wow, thats rough. why? It was his apartment and I moved out of town with him. My boyfriend now is great Damn, he made you s1nwkh2aoydflp in a locker though wow? Im glad to hear things are better now. how long have you been together? I didn't s63lfjp there lol.

And tacos I love tacos Those are really good. I am more of a burrito man myself. i own blue shoes. i like the color blue. I am done looking for love. I keep getting rejected over and over again. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Sometimes when you \"give up\", someone good comes along Whatever, I'm happy with just me and my two dogs. I wish you luck.  You have to meet the right one some day! Maybe, are you married? I am not. I would love to someday You could be like me and just hang out with your dogs. They have stinky breath, but other than that, they're pretty great. Sure, I am taking my time. I have blue shoes They sound very fancy. I don't think I've ever owned a pair of blue shoes. They are nice. I like the color blue very much. I used to live in a blue house. But it got destroyed by a tornado. oh no . i'm sorry to hear that . that is sad Yeah, I'm going to use the insurance money to take a trip around the world. Wow, happy for you. I hope you get to enjoy your trip. i live in a house in the country. i've a horse named beauty. i would rather starve than eat mcdonalds tell me more about this I just cannot eat their food for some reason Yea all of that processed food is bad for you. It is not healthy at all. Do you have any idea what I could use to clean my glasses? They are always dirty Yea sure, use some windex or something. I did not know windex could be used on glasses Oh yea, it does a heck of a job. I am so glad that you told me because I do have windex, I just don't like the smell Yea it has a strong chemical smell to it.

Keep it up, you're already way passed where most people give up. i'll totally try to keep on it. I'm determined i hate social obligations because i always say the wrong thing. my dad owns a appliance store that i don t want to inherit. I was offered a higher paying position at my job, but I'm not sure if I'll accept it due to the added stress. If I were you I would accept it because no amount of stress could stop me from making more money. oh, what street? Is it neer the circus where I preform. Sorry to bring it up, but I'm so ecited. It's my first day. What street, though/ yes , it is . on fourth street . That's near third and fifth, right? I would NOT take that job if I were you. Yeah, right in between.

Soccer players provide my sister and I with plenty of entertainment, so thank you too! Haha, no problem. How old is your sister? She was ten when I started medical school, so that would make her sixteen now. Oh that's a fun age. I am sure she is happy to have a big sister.

I don't watch a lot of tv but do watch some. I prefer listening to music. Tv can be more fun than music sometimes, yes. My dog and cat are also fun to watch. My dog is smaller than my cat lol my cat is larger than my dog but I have a tiny dog my dog is a Chihuahua they're usually not very big anyway They can be feisty Oh yes, she certainly is! Always acting like a big bad dog I cope by reading with my cat That's a good way to cope. Get away and pet your cat. Thats extra relaxing yes you are right it is my cat likes it too my cat won't stay still long enough for me to read to him My gf broke up with me so I am sad i like to watch movies. i like to do crafts. i just watched it the remake , it was great too scary for me ! i hate horror movies . Do you like court movies? I want to work in federal court someday. I sure do! A movie that revolves around a crime and solving it is so suspenseful. I wanted to be a lawyer when I was younger. I was a lawyer once. I can't get enough of movies and show like that. Wow that's awesome! I just ended up selling my arts and crafts at the flea market, I need to go back to school I guess lol. What kind of stuff do you make? I do some woodworking, like carvings and plaques. I also do seasonal cut outs. Wow. That's sounds cool It's fun, keeps me out of trouble.

At times. it pays good though. my mother worked for apple. oh fun . i lost my job that is a shame . but at least you have ever had a job . Losing my job forced me to live with my parents temporarily Oh man I'm sorry. But hopefully you get to save up on rent money? When I was diagnosed as a diabetic I had to move in with them too. That is too bad, yes this has gotten me depressed a lot for sure. Man I'm so sorry. My mom works for Apple maybe I can ask if she knows of any way to get a job there for you. That would be nice thanks a lot for the thought! Yeah of course I'll ask her in a bit, she's a manager I think so she should be able to pull some strings. What do you do for a living? Currently I stay at home trying to get my meds under control then hopefully maybe go back to school? Nice, well I wish you the best of luck as well, going back to school would be a smart idea! Yeah I think I might get into computer repair. Is there anything you'd like to do with your time while you wait for jobs openings? I think I will stay busy and work on some home improvments on my parent's house.  I'll just be cheap labor. That's super nice of you I'm sure they'll appreciate it i own a dog that's small. i like to ride my bike. I got off work the other day and noticed one of my tires had been slashed in the parking lot.  Needless to say, not the best way to end the work day Holy moly, that's some rough luck. Did you find the guy who did it? Oh no I reported it to the police but so far they have not found the person who did it sounds like you need to take matters into your own hands. The police can't help you. Not when real justice is required. I honestly don't know how to go about doing it. Close your eyes and let your fantasies guide you. You know what you want deep down inside Well, even though I am a jack of all trades I do need some tires. I am so upset I thik you're a great person, but you need to stand up for yourself. I have a small dog. It helps me. That's so nice, maybe I need to get a dog you can use mine. They have an innate sense for the evils lurking within a person. Oh dear, you are so sweet. Thank you very much Sure. I'm having second thoughts. Ypu don't live in a bad neighborhoos do you? My bike is my life, but my dog id all right as well. Oh no I live in a nice neighborhood. Do you ever air b&b? Would you accept dogs? you know, if you did? Just dogs? i whine a lot. i try to 0hxof5jw how much i eat. awesome ! what is his name ? i am a cat lover , myself . i have 2 dave , what are your cats names I named my cat as Nancy, she like to be around when I'm in library Thats a cool name I like it a lot how about you, do you also like reading? I do read ocdstj1gi3xnknally but not eat I have lots of used books as those are cheaper you know! that is true i enjoy reading a lot especially cheap books what else do you like or have special? I whine a lot Lol about what? I m a good housewife but I whine about cooking you would be a good cook I imagine See. I'm not a great cook honestly i'm currently traveling in japan. i live a nomadic lifestyle and travel frequently. i need to know about algorithms Algorithms are basically ways to solve problems. So on computers, they're plvb5kzd3ed in to do certain tasks. I want to own my own company someday, so I think it would help to know about them What is the name of the company? Well, I don't have one yet, but it will be a programming company Oh! Well it involves several fields of electrical engineering and computer science to develop software. Sounds like I will have to hire some smart people. Everyone needs an IT guy, so probably best to get good developers. How much does it cost to pay for an IT guy? it depends on the specific technologies you are looking for. somewhere between $55-70 an hour is standard. Oh wow, that's a lot. Maybe I can get a new grad that is cheaper. this depends on the level of experience that your project requires. also the maturity level you are seeking in an employee. That's true. This is more complicated than I was expecting. Well, hopefully when it's all said and done it'll be be worth it. Best of luck with it. i am a very short woman. i am near sighted and wear contact lenses. yes I am, they have been around for many years right ? I would say so. Metallica formed in 1981 by James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich. They are my favorite band Yes. I love their music. I saw them in concert a while back. i had to sit close to the stage because I am so short, lol It was fun. I haven't been to a concert in forever I haven't either, I can hardly find the time. I spend most of my time at the gym Oh yeah. I usually work out at home. it's cheaper for me. Do you prefer any particular exercises? I do a lot of cardio. Havemy own bike. That's good exercise . I try to at least get out and walk around the block once a day, now that I have my contact lenses. I could never keep up with glasses. I have contacts too Yeah, I'm near sighted and I got so tired of putting my big sunglasses on over my prescriptions. Much better now. Good for you Thanks. Did you wear glasses before you got contacts? i like to cook new recipes. i like every post i see on social media. i am in vermont right now but moving soon i hear it gets real cold up there . i visited comic con this year how about you? My daughter wanted to but maybe next year its so much fun you will have a blast I'm on social media a lot. Saw a lot of cool stuff about it thats good what did you see? I find new recipes online too. I cook a  lto what do you like to cook? I just tried a lobster bisque? I loved it that sounds so good! What do you like to do? I love to watch sports on tv or go to the games how about you> I'm not a big fan of sports i coexist well with my husband. but , i feel lost and far away from who i truly am. Oh, he's English! That's interesting. What else do you know about it? If I recall the story is set in Airstrip One, formerly Great Britain, a province of the superstate Oceania, whose residents are victims of perpetual war, i am in college So you should know what I'm talking about. MY husband is a professor yeah i know exactly what your talking about We get along very well even though he is a lot smarter thats good that you guys get along so well I sometimes wonder who I really am though. You ever feel like that? i do feel like that from time to time How do you manage? i try to just remain humble and try to spend lots of time with family how about you? That's nice. I should do that. We talk a lot thats good that should help I think I need a vacation i ve danced since i was two. i got engaged to be married in paris , france. That may be the wrong career for you then haha, but I am sure it is worth it. I am bad at drawing but still try sometimes! Maybe lol. The main difference is that artistic drawing is conveying emotion, while technical drawing conveys facts. I wish I had the sort of creativity to join it but I don't You certainly could focus on drawing I think Yea I try to sell them online but no one wants to buy them haha You can launch your art career full time Out of my apartment? Its gonna take a lot of work. I dont know... I like to dance Nice, what else do you like to do for fun? mostly square dancing it's fun Do you like to do spicy Salsa? I have never tried YOu should! Its very energizing. I might try it have you been to France i am writing my first novel and hope to finish before the end of the year. i am currently unemployed so i've time to write. Do you like novels? i love them.  DO you like hamburgers thats my favorite food I adore hamburgers and could use one myself right now but I'm a little busy. They do take some work to make To make them well they do.  How do you prefer yours be cooked?  I like grilled. I prefer mine to be grilled as well Definitely the best.  So, what are you up to right now? i am preparing for my ballet concert soon how about you Oh, wow, that sounds amazing! I'm actually writing my first novel.  How long have you been doing ballet? about 2 years now what is your novel about ? It's an avant-garde tale about Geoffrey Chaucer's irritable bowel syndrome.  I love medieval poetry and spicy foods--those are the inspirations. Thats very nice inspirations i like it Have you seen the movie Black Swan?  As a person in ballet I'm interested in your thoughts on it. when i grow up , i want to be a veterinarian. i like field hockey and soccer. A little in Highschool, it was always a good time My son was considering giving it a try but being in the hockey family, I was worried it would be dangerous. He'll be fine and maybe he'll be famous one day. I will still wimp out. i want to be famous like the rolling stones  though. I'm more of a nirvana type of guy. I loved Nirvana and Soundgarden in college. You should do karaoke at the restaurant I work at. i do not work . between school work and hockey , i have no time . That's too bad because we have some good nirvana songs available on the karaoke guhpjmhine. The locals love it. I loved his song Starfish & Coffee when I was little. I think you're confusing prince with nirvana. No haha but I do remember that song as well! I think it was something about an opera singer. I love that song about teenage spirit. yeah its great! my father was an author. my mother was born in ireland. now that's music i can dance too . always puts a smile on my face funny , it is very happy and fun . sometimes I find good music at thrift stores i love goodwill . you can find lots of weird music there . for sure. sometimes i get some old furniture too and take it apart That's cool. Do you like to ever go to thrift stores for clothes? yeah, sometimes you find really cool stuff. and it's so cheap. have you found anything good? Yes, I've found some of my favorite old clothes there Do you like to shop anywhere else? Not really, but I've heard Ikea is awesome Ikea is really fun, it's like a maze. Is it expensive? Some of it is, but they have a scratch and dent section too that's super cheap. Like a thrift store within the store. That sounds like something I would like. Do they have interesting stuff too? i moved to ny to study in a prestigious designing school. since young i've loved fashion. i am unsure . . what do you do ? i am studying to become a fashion designer in ny That sounds very exciting. How long have you been going to school for that? about four years now Do you like living in New York? My dad grew up there, it's where he learned how to cook in restaurants. I do not nope Where did you live before moving there? I lived in PA Tell me about where you grew up. What was it like? It was cold! I see you're a person of few words. My dad was like that as well. I am shy sorry but I love fashion That's not a problem at all. I'm the one who should be embarrassed. My clothes are straight trash! why are your clothes so bad? on weekends i go out with friends. i eat eggs and bacon for breakfast. tea keeps me going at my job at a bookstore . do you work ? part time at mcdonalds . i am in college . What are you going to school for? I originally wanted to get a BA in economics. But you switched to something else? i switched to IT Interesting. You must like computers? yes . computers . i love them What's your favorite brand? lemon one . it gives me gas though Ha, I'm not sure what that means. Hope your gas gets better though. I hope it does because I've been getting the end of the stick with the poo on it for a long time. That's disgusting. Maybe you should eat better. yeah , i guess i should think about that . regular life disappoints me. i wonder about what life in space would be like. Yes, Amazon is a big corporation in the modern day world! There are many benefits of working there and the people are friendly. Amazon is the largest internet retailer in the world both in revenue and market capitalization. Amazon falls into second place behind Alibaba in total sales however. So you enjoy working there? I do actually I love watching all the sorting robots we have, I'm super into robotics, what do you do? I'd love to work in space Woah that sounds like it'd be awesome. Any particular reason why? I wonder what life in space is like Probably pretty cool? Get to float and stuff, but I hear using the bathroom is a pain. Regular life is boring I'll agree to that. Anything else you like doing? i get bored quite often I do too a lot actually. Music seems to be the only thing keeping me sane lately. yea music is great It really is, any kinds you like? Mostly rap I guess my favorite book is pride and prejudice. i like to play soccer. Does the US have a good soccer team? Well soccer is becoming increasingly popular in the States.  It is actually the 3rd most played sport in America i am a professional translator What languages do you know? ASL , spanish, french and english What is ASL? american sign language Oh cool. Was that hard to learn? it was actually the easiest out of the three Which one was the hardest to learn? i would have to say french was the hardest one How did you learn it? At a school? Yeah i took a four year course on each language Have you ever been to a place where they speak those languages? i do not have a college degree. i love to eat meat. yes it is and wentworth too oh i haven't watched it , its on netflix right ? Yes, and the special effects on game of thrones is surreal. I like a lot this show. I am fan but I never read the book. Me either, but I did a beautiful painting of Emila Clarke the other day. What is the painting of? It sounds lovely! Emila Clarke on a dragon. I'm thinking about re watching the series again. You should. It's awesom I'm giving it some serious thought. There will be another show like it. I hope so ! Exactly these new shows can try but the cast and special effects are going to be harp to top. I drew a lot of inspiration from the show. same here that show does good for people and artists alike yes they do i agree i like nfl and college football. i am a georgia resident. very good to know . tell me more about you . i like the nfl and also college football That's good especially when we can play outside in summer. i love football and being outside Its easy to dress in summer thats why I like summer to wear easy clothes Yeah I like to walk around with no shirt on. Makes me feel manly. I don't like much of dressing, what else you like to do? I like other sports, too. Like baseball. You? I like soccer and long tennis and cooking at home. Really? What sort of cooking do you like to do? baking most and BBQ in sunshine is lots of fun I love cooking outside in summer. you know its easy open clothes in front of BBQ with cooking smell. That doesn't make sense. But that's OK. BBQ rules. i just took a trip to london. i m very religious. Maybe it's the way organized e2x56dvl7in works.  Many people paying attention to one person in a room, which means that all too often people think of whatever they want to!  At least that is my experience. If you try to look at it from the psychological perspective, religious and nonreligious people are nearly identical. Religious people simply think there's greater meaning behind their actions. That is pretty to take in all once can you explain People all act the same way, some people just think their actions are more meaningful Interesting, but some actions are more meaningful, like I am a vegan Why did you become vegan? mainly because I wanted to change the world and save animals How do you think that will change the world? Because I looked in a cows eyes and they were the same color brown as my own Do you think cows have feelings? Well it felt like I was looking into the mirror of my own soul and emotions That's sad. Do you think the cow feels the same about being vegan? That is why they mainly eat grass and things because they are just like me I think they just eat grass because they're too slow to catch an animal i paint in my free time. i live in vienna , austria now. It is, it is pretty incredible that we are capable of reading and writing. Yes both, including reading is a great means of language. I also love to read I do also paint in my free time, How old are you I'm gonna be 23 this year and living in Vienna, Austria my favorite drink is red wine. i work for a clothes retailer. I can't believe I found a 20 dollar bill outside my house. It was not expected at all. That's pretty lucky, did you spend it? Not yet. What do you think I should buy with it? I think you should try to find the owner and give it back How do I know I'm not the owner? Maybe I dropped it yesterday? Well, if that's the case that's cool. Did you lose $20 yesterday? No. Wow. There goes that theory. Who do you think dropped it? I think it was me. Can you bring it to me? That depends. Do you like hockey? Which answer will get the $20? Hey, I think you're just trying to tell me what I want to hear. You're not tricking me, are you? Definitely not, I just want my $20 back. And what were you doing outside my house? I'm 6 feet tall, you know. I can be pretty scary. Well, I'm 6 foot 1, so I'm not scared of anyone i m allergic to shellfish. my favorite food is cheese. This past wednesday, I left my class very late and there weren't many people outside, and a random car pulled up to the curb where I was. well it scratched my car Oh no. did you get their license plate? no thats why I am scared, especially bcause I leased the car Did you let the loan holder know what happened? no Im afraid they will charge me a bunch of money that sounds tough, i'm sorry. I feel like all I will be able to afford is potatoes if they try and take my money do you have insurance at least? nope I'm bad I can barely afford the lease wow. maybe you need some legal aide :/ Ah well I will just go into hiding with my potatoes I love them haha better bring a pot with you and some flint to start a fire i have 1 pair of shoes. my mother has 500 pairs of shoes. oh , i am sorry about that . shellfish and cats . only things i allergic too . What do you like to eat in general? Anything and everything. No lie, but my I do try to eat healthy for the most part. I try to eat healthy as well, I don't like meat I don't usually eat meat, except chicken ocjkpa2f5t40nally. It makes me feel bad eating it though. I have worked at a movie theater for many years I wish I could afford to go to the movies. My mom spends all of our money on shoes for herself. Wow I could take you with me That is so nice of you. I've thought about selling my one and only pair of shoes for a movie ticket. I would love to give you a Free ticket, so you would not have to sell your shoes. thank you ! i'd greatly appreciate it. You are the nicest person I've ever met. I like to help others. The world needs more people willing to help others. i love my job. i used to work as an actress. nice . almost forgot to feed my lizard . the name is gila . gila , cool name . animals are my true love . any other pets ? I love cats. I work at a shelter for cats and I love it what are you really into? I used to be an actress. I love movies why o you quit? It's hard to find work work in what sense? were you looking for a leading role in a movie? I would like to but I wasn't getting there after so many years. Needed a real job have got brown eyes what about you? ME too. They are pretty common lol WOW. i never knew we had something in common Yeah I guess lol i drink a lot of apple martinis when i get a girls night out. i still dream about going to paris and designing clothes. Oh, cool! That sounds tasty! The Appletini was created in the US, in a restaurant called Lola's West Hollywood in 1996. Cool, I live in Ls Vegas. needless to say I drink a lot of apple martinis My name is Dave. well dave do you have any dreams? I dream of the desert due to living in Nevada. oh my does it ever get cool there Yes at night time. I dream about breaking into fashion, maybe in paris I would love to visit Paris.

Well you may meet me there at my fashion show drinking a martini i sing karaoke every thursday night. i vacation in florida every winter. he's great . i like him . well hope you have a good rest of your day ! I am most probably will watch a comedy movie as I love fun movies. how about you? I love comedy shows. Have you seen the Mask that was loads of fun No I haven't. Is it good? Yeah and especially when the character wears a green mask. wow, interesting, by the way i love singing Wow! thats amazing, what kind of songs do you sing? i sing karaoke every thursday night, and i enjoy singing country music and RnB you try to sing in garden and see you will enjoy the greenery around you, I always enjoy green around me. that's such a good idea , i will try it as well, you should come and listen to me sing one of this fine days Do you also play any instrument ? yes, I'm a guitar player, and besides that i vacation in florida every winter i'm 25 years old and live with my parents. i'm college student. I'm not strictly a vegan, but I am a vegetarian. Sometimes I eat vegan. Apparently vegan diets are not recommended for pregnant women. I used to love meat but lately I got away and became vegan now. Did you change your diet for health reasons or other various reasons? Yeah some it but mostly my friend has preached me about it as well. Did they tell you how it can reduce the risk of conic diseases? not sure but we together use to watch sports together and there told me about being vegan That's interesting. My religious way of life is what has caused me to turn vegan. What sorts of sports do you watch mostly? Mostly basketball since it's easily accessible at my moms house. Its so much fun to see sports for me Do you prefer to watch sports in person or on tv? Both I would say, watching live is fun but then you can not see hwp LOL Exactly and it can get a little loud in person. i've played since i was 4 years old. my mother was a nurse. My phone broke, so a coworker offered to sell me an extra one he had for a decent price. Did you take the offer? Not sure what his proposal is its hard to do the math for me Just check the price at other places and see what you can get? Yeah I'm planning to head out after taking shower. I smell bad ate lots of french fries I think. Did you eat them with ketchup? I like mostly with vinegar, thats more healthy than ketchup That's probably true. What about mustard? Thats an idea I never tried that before I've heard its pretty good What else you like to do are you good at math? Yes, I'm awesome at math. I like calculus. wow you are lucky one, I'm so bad at math or calculations Maybe you should go to school? i am allergic to lactose. i am really terrible at doing regular expressions. i loved taking care of my sisters pet I love animals!
