- I believe it is due to their behavior and internal and external stimuli.
- I'd like to introduce that dog to my pet snakes. I think they'd eat him though!
- Oh no! But I think black snakes are good? They eat nasty bugs and rodents!
- My snakes are both pythons. I feed them mice. Do you have any pets?
- No, but I would love to have a cat for it to hunt mice in my house lol
- You have mice running around your house? Yikes! I think I'd rather have the barking dogs than that.
- Lol, but they do make great companions at times.I give them bread and they leave me alone for the most part.
- Have you given them names? If not, maybe we can come up with some.
