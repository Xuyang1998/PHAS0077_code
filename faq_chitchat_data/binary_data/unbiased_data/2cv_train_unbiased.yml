    - I have never been but I have heard the same. I love snow and the mountains.
    - I wish I could enjoy the snow and mountains, I would be afraid I could not answer my cellphone!
    - Haha, these days it is amazing where you can get cell service.
    - i agree ! that is the main reason I have a phone !
    - Do you have any plans this weekend?
    - No plans yet, I'm just happy to sh2zgarp in for once!
    - i love to go out to eat with my family.
    - i like to go to the movies.
    - that is good. I have 2
    - He's a good worker but not as reliable as I am. He is always calling in or not putting much effort into his work. I feel I should have gotten that position.
    - That's a shame, if that's the case then I agree.
    - Yea, but to be perfectly honest, I actually don't work hard either.
    - oh i see . i am really reliable in my job on other things i am not
    - Well my problem is that I just never had to really work. I always had money. What things are you not reliable in?
    - Mostly jobs and children.
    - What do you mean children?
    - 5 & 7.  they take up a lot of my time
    - They are food, shelter, child care, health care, transportation, and utilities.
    - Ok, Im pretty confused as to what you mean, but that sounds like a lot.
    - it is a lot to take care of because kids are a lot of responsibility
    - I see. Well good luck with that, I wouldn't know because I don't have kids yet.
    - oh well thank you . what else should i know about you ?
    - Well, Im going through some drama right now with my sister in law, she hates me.
    - Family conflict is always hard.  Maybe you should be the bigger man and work for peace
    - i work as a teacher and love my job.
    - i've two dogs who are like my babies.
    - My boss earns way more money than me for less work.
    - That must be so annoying. You should ask for a pay raise.
    - yeah, i think i will!
    - I love my job as a teacher but would also like to assk for a raise
    - who do you ask? aren't teacher salaries decided by some sort of... thing, or whatever? i love my family.
    - I would ask the school board they base it on how long you've been there and test scores
    - how would the principal feel about you going behind his back?
    - Not sure, I suppose I could sit down and discuss it with him. What kind of work do you do?
    - i'm a garbage man, although i'm a woman. my boss drives the truck, but i'm more qualified, really.
    - I've never driven a truck, only small vehicles! How's that working out for you? My two dogs would love to ride along if I did that
    - dogs would for sure love a big truck full of garbage. i thik i'm the top 20 or so best garbage men in the area
    - oh wow that is impressive . must be an extremely difficult job .
    - no.literally anyone could do it. you just pick up garbage. it's not as easy as teaching, im sure, buts ittakes no skill
    - i have woman calling me all the time.
    - I got really joyful when my dad got me my first vehicle. It was just a happy feeling
    - Yeah. I know that feeling., although I had to buy my own.
    - The vehicle was exactly what I wanted, a newer model sports car.
    - That was a good choice, What kind of car was it?
    - A Mustang GT, convertible
    - Nice! Too bad you couldn't get  your hands on a 1963 Mustang II. That's my favorite car.
    - A few years ago I helped with a restoration on a 67. It was absolutely gorgeous.
    - That sounds awesome. Did you restore it with your dad?
    - dancing is my passion.
    - i'm terrible at math.
    - I enjoy dance a lot as well, my daughter does tap dancing. What kind of dancing do you like most?
    - I don't have a particular favorite style, but I've always thought tap was the odd one, even though you see it all the time on Broadway.
    - Tap is pretty odd compared to the others. My daughter loves ballet.
    - i love broadway shows , so this was the closest thing i had .
    - Yea, well keep it up, maybe one day you'll be on broadway.
    - i hope so. i'm so bad at math. they count 5,6,7,8! at the beginning, and i wish they would stick to smaller numbers
    - hahah that's funny. I believe in you though, you can overcome that.
    - it's like a chorus line. the musical with actor michael douglass. have you seen it/
    - No I haven't, I don't watch movies very often. Im usually out at clubs people watching.
    - when do you think you'll get a chance to catch up on some film? I love dancing, but when I'm not treading the boards, I love watching tv
    - Probably not for a while. I just bought a new jaguar and I try to get out and just drive around and show it off as much as possible.
    - wow, i love animals. What does it eat?
    - Haha the car not the animal. A jaguar would eat me as I tried to feed it for sure.
    - do you hink people like looking at you r car? I heard they are hard to maintain
    - i'm a reality tv star.
    - i listen to country music.
    - i wish i was there
    - i saw lots of animals . reminded me of when i worked for a circus .
    - You worked for a circus? Tell me you jycgled while riding a unicycle and had a monkey on your shoulder.
    - No, I couldn't do that.
    - Me neither, but that might be because I like to drink...a lot.
    - I drink a lot too because I am a reality tv star and it is stressful
    - Are you famous? I'm kind of famous in my own town.
    - yes, i am famous. what type of music do you listen to?
    - My favorite singer is Meatloaf, are you a fan of his?
    - never heard of him, i only listen to country music honestly
    - Not only is Meatloaf a great singer, but it's also a delicious food. Can't beat that combo.
    - Food is the gateway to the soul.
    - And meatloaf is the express train to my heart. Nothing like a little hamburg and spices to get things going.
    - that sounds delicious
    - i've a masters degree in creative writing.
    - i live in a medium sized city.
    - I recently got a $50 gift card that I'm really looking forward to using.
    - That's awesome. I'd be excited too. What are you going to get with it?
    - I think I am going to get a new camera.
    - what happened to your old one?
    - Nothing but I want an upgrade.
    - why can't you just use the one on your phone?
    - I am trying to do professional photography.
    - Wow. I love writing fiction creatively, and that would make a great story. What sort of phone did you start out with?
    - You know just a flip phone haha. Are you working on a book right now?
    - It's about these pills that reveal the world is full of dinosaurs, but you can't ee them without the pills, so you don't know where they are
    - Oh! Interesting! That would be scary.
    - it's a drama, actually, and the dinosaurs don;t bother anyone. would you ever take a picture of something like that?
    - Of course! That would make my career!
    - oh cool. what sort of shutter speed would u set it on?
    - i like lightning mcqueen.
    - i have a cat named mater.
    - Roommate just walked in on me while I was... trying to... "feel good" if you know what I mean. So awkward. My door doesn't have a lock, either. I told him to not come in, and he just kept coming in!
    - I not sure what do you mean, but can use my imagination,  it sounds like something really embarrassing.
    - It was. I don't know why I didn't just stop doing it.
    - Probably a good idea . Now i'm not sure what to say . An awkward ordeal.
    - Neither am I. I'm not even sure why I brought up such a thing in a random conversation.
    - Try not to let it get to you.  Life is weird. Things happen and then you move on.
    - Amen to that. Anyway, do you like to read?
    - I do like reading. Lately I've been reading about Lightning McQueen. Do you like the movie "Cars"?
    - Is that the animated movie?
    - Yeah they have made a few of them. I like them so much I named my cat mater after the tow truck in the film.
    - Oh thats really cool. Yea I love those movies a lot! Whats your favorite food?
    - I love chicken, and Chinese food. Well, just about any food actually. How about you?
    - I love pizza, its definitely my favorite of all time. Chinese is great too though. Have you had chinese pizza before?
    - Yes! The Chinese restaurant down the street has it. It's pretty good.
    - my weakness are sweets.
    - that isn't bad either
    - i find that i'm not a sociable person
    - that is okay, everyone is different
    - yeah I'm pretty different if you get what I mean
    - no i do not get what you mean, care to elaborate?
    - well we have  sub personality that tends to control or feelings
    - i think the crystals i dabble with can change your sub personality
    - oh wow I hear that stuff is bad for you
    - im addicted to the power of them
    - I really can't stop eating sweets myself
    - you will stop when you get diabetes
    - Yeah I was told the same thing, but I'm addicted. unlucky
    - meditation will dissolve all addictions
    - I will try medicine first
    - i played football in college.

    - my eyes are bright blue.
    - i do not have a college degree.
    - I am going on a flight for the first time in a couple weeks. I am really scared for some reason!
    - Good for you. Is it truly your first time flying on a plane?
    - Yea, I have a really bad feeling that its going to crash or something.
    - oh. my god. i never fiinished college, so i'm willing to listen to you explain your psychic visions to me
    - Ok well, I had a vision last night that aliens would attack my plane and we would crash.
    - we're on the same plane? what country are these illegals from? like hijackers?
    - No why would you be on my flight a couple weeks from now? They are from another planet, most likely Jupiter.
    - sounds like i'd be better off just cancelling our trip and going back to finish my degree. what do you think?
    - Would you? I think that is for the best. It's safer.
    - do you have to take off your shoes at airports still? I know like in japan you probably do, but is it everywhere?
    - I think so, what Im not sure about though is if they every give them back to you. I think they might just mail them to you
    - yeah, there's a fed ex in there for that. Where are you going on your trip?
    - I am going to Japan actually but then Im flying right back. I'm really just going for the flying experience.
    - Smart. You don't want your airline miles to expire. Are you getting a meal? Maybe a hot towl?

    - I can agree with that. Have you heard the news recently?
    - No. I have not turned on the tv
    - There is new footage of an alien ship plying over the ocean.
    - wow that would be exciting and scary .
    - I always knew they watched over us.
    - Something like the Aliens in the film franchise?
    - Yes it is shocking to watch.

    - That's pretty neat. It must be hard to take care of curly hair.
    - Its a long process but I love it
    - I have had a dog that had curly hair. It was a mixed poodle and it was red. Really active animal she was.
    - My aunt had a poodle greyhound mix. She was gorgeous
    - That mix of dog breeds sounds cool. Was she tall like the greyhound or short like the poodle? You get all kinds of unique traits
    - Tall and pretty grey coat
    - Beautiful type of dog. We had one growing up as a kid. Hard to keep him contained
    - I loved that dog and I'm a cat person.
    - I feel you. Cats are sometimes easier to have around. We have four of them now haha.
    - Cool. We are going to adopt when we move soon.

    - You seem to know a lot about serial killers!
    - Well, I think it's important to learn about human nature in all forms, don't you? It's how we evolve.
    - Absolutely, although I find them too scary. I prefer to stick to collecting stamps.
    - Haha yea, I understand that. I am actually a writer so I have to do a lot of research on such things unfortunately
    - Ah, yes, the lucrative writing career. (Just kidding), What types of stuff do you write?

    - Was playing rough with my relatives, running around outside, doing touch football. I think I twisted my ankle or something. I'm dumb and don't have health insurance this year.. Worried how much money I'm gonna have to spend
    - Hopefully it is just a sprain. Might not need to receive medical attention.
    - It hurts badly so I am afraid I may have to see a doctor.
    - Yeah, maybe you should just put some ice on it? It's supposed to be ice on and off for 10 min intervels.We learned that in self defense class.
    - Oh that is a good idea, I will be taking your advice. but what if that does not work?
    - Could look into doctors in your area that take self pay, some help with making payments and some have programs for uninsured.
    - In today's world no one will take pity on me. The pain is excruciating. I think I need pain killers too
    - Seriously, I'm also uninsured, wanted to move to Vegas but the rates there for healthcare were worse than my place, I'm sorry
    - I am so sorry to hear that you are in the same boat as me. We really need insurance.
    - Would be nice for sure, but not too much we can do I guess, besides the injury anything good happen recently?
    - Well My mate proposed to me yesterday, I am so happy
    - Oh wow that's awesome to hear! A big congrats to the both of you!

    - i like swimming.
    - I like to swim. I don't do it much but I like it. Have never tried the backstroke style. Is it hard?
    - It is not hard. especially those who fear not being able to breath, backstroke is the best
    - It sounds like good exercise
    - It is. I have gotten in much better shape since I started. Counteracts all of the video games I play, lol. Do you like video games?
    - Yes, i play a lot. Probably too much.
    - As long as you get up every now and then to stretch you're alright, lol. I love racing games the most.
    - I like RPG. Something to make me feel less lonely.
    - I like those games too! Sometimes I like to just go off and pretend I am someone else and have fun in those games.
    - Exactly! The games today are amazing!
    - They really are. It's amazing how far the games have come since back in the day. i still like classic games, too.
    - Same here, sometimes I play mario kart.
    - Mario Kart was a great game! I was so good at dropping those bananas! Nintendo has become one of the most influential video game companies in the industry!
    - It really has. The CEO seems like a good person.
    - Yeah, they really seem to care about the games they put out.
    - i live alone in a cabin.
    - i like to go fishing on the lake.
    - Yah, but I hate it when I wack a ball into a pond.
    - yes me too!  on a course there are holes to hit the ball in which is 4.25 inches in diameter.
    - that is more than enough size for a hole, i should pay that course a visit
    - oh, you simply must. It gets so lonely here, for me, in my isolated cabin.
    - do you work?
    - I'mnot sure. Maybe? I fish. I fish in the lake. Do you know it?
    - no i do not have much time to fish at lakes because i am busy at the large law firm i work at
    - I love law. I had jury duty once and the law seemed so official. I'm jealous.
    - what are you jealous of?
    - how you must interract with people. All the cool rules and the way you can approach the bench. law clerks, stenographers, it rules.
    - you should try to get a job in law then
    - If there was any law and order around the isolated cabin and the lake where I fish, I would get into it.
    - ahh it sounds like you are really attached to your cabin
    - Confined you might say. And the lake. I can never leave. I love the fishing.
    - i like to go to comic con.
    - my father recently had a heart attack.

    - Oh yea, it does a heck of a job.
    - I am so glad that you told me because I do have windex, I just don't like the smell
    - Yea it has a strong chemical smell to it.
    - I don't think that would be the best to use for cleaning my glasses
    - Probably not the best, but it was all I could think of.

    - my dad owns a appliance store that i don t want to inherit.

    - yes , it is . on fourth street .
    - That's near third and fifth, right? I would NOT take that job if I were you.

    - Do you play soccer a lot?
    - yes , soccer i am very good . I have a good team.
    - I wish I could join a soccer team. I'm to busy filling prescriptions all the time.
    - You are doing a great service to people. Thank you!
    - Soccer players provide my sister and I with plenty of entertainment, so thank you too!
    - Haha, no problem. How old is your sister?
    - She was ten when I started medical school, so that would make her sixteen now.
    - Oh that's a fun age. I am sure she is happy to have a big sister.

    - Wow that's awesome! I just ended up selling my arts and crafts at the flea market, I need to go back to school I guess lol.

    - Man I'm so sorry. My mom works for Apple maybe I can ask if she knows of any way to get a job there for you.
    - That would be nice thanks a lot for the thought!
    - Yeah of course I'll ask her in a bit, she's a manager I think so she should be able to pull some strings.
    - What do you do for a living?
    - Currently I stay at home trying to get my meds under control then hopefully maybe go back to school?
    - Nice, well I wish you the best of luck as well, going back to school would be a smart idea!
    - Yeah I think I might get into computer repair. Is there anything you'd like to do with your time while you wait for jobs openings?

    - That's super nice of you I'm sure they'll appreciate it
    - i own a dog that's small.
    - i like to ride my bike.
    - I got off work the other day and noticed one of my tires had been slashed in the parking lot.  Needless to say, not the best way to end the work day
    - Holy moly, that's some rough luck. Did you find the guy who did it?
    - Oh no I reported it to the police but so far they have not found the person who did it
    - sounds like you need to take matters into your own hands. The police can't help you. Not when real justice is required.
    - I honestly don't know how to go about doing it.
    - Close your eyes and let your fantasies guide you. You know what you want deep down inside
    - Well, even though I am a jack of all trades I do need some tires. I am so upset
    - I thik you're a great person, but you need to stand up for yourself. I have a small dog. It helps me.
    - That's so nice, maybe I need to get a dog
    - you can use mine. They have an innate sense for the evils lurking within a person.
    - Oh dear, you are so sweet. Thank you very much

    - Oh! Well it involves several fields of electrical engineering and computer science to develop software.
    - Sounds like I will have to hire some smart people.
    - Everyone needs an IT guy, so probably best to get good developers.
    - How much does it cost to pay for an IT guy?
    - it depends on the specific technologies you are looking for. somewhere between $55-70 an hour is standard.
    - Oh wow, that's a lot. Maybe I can get a new grad that is cheaper.
    - this depends on the level of experience that your project requires. also the maturity level you are seeking in an employee.
    - That's true. This is more complicated than I was expecting.
    - Well, hopefully when it's all said and done it'll be be worth it. Best of luck with it.

    - i m very religious.
    - Maybe it's the way organized vzrdgnmt17e4 works.  Many people paying attention to one person in a room, which means that all too often people think of whatever they want to!  At least that is my experience.
    - If you try to look at it from the psychological perspective, religious and nonreligious people are nearly identical. Religious people simply think there's greater meaning behind their actions.
    - That is pretty to take in all once can you explain
    - People all act the same way, some people just think their actions are more meaningful
    - Interesting, but some actions are more meaningful, like I am a vegan
    - Why did you become vegan?
    - mainly because I wanted to change the world and save animals
    - How do you think that will change the world?
    - Because I looked in a cows eyes and they were the same color brown as my own
    - Do you think cows have feelings?
    - Well it felt like I was looking into the mirror of my own soul and emotions
    - That's sad. Do you think the cow feels the same about being vegan?
    - That is why they mainly eat grass and things because they are just like me
    - I think they just eat grass because they're too slow to catch an animal
    - i paint in my free time.

    - That's pretty lucky, did you spend it?
    - Not yet. What do you think I should buy with it?
    - I think you should try to find the owner and give it back
    - How do I know I'm not the owner? Maybe I dropped it yesterday?
    - Well, if that's the case that's cool. Did you lose $20 yesterday?
    - No. Wow. There goes that theory. Who do you think dropped it?
    - I think it was me. Can you bring it to me?
    - That depends. Do you like hockey?
    - Which answer will get the $20?
    - Hey, I think you're just trying to tell me what I want to hear. You're not tricking me, are you?
    - Definitely not, I just want my $20 back.

    - no thats why I am scared, especially bcause I leased the car
    - Did you let the loan holder know what happened?
    - no Im afraid they will charge me a bunch of money
    - that sounds tough, i'm sorry.
    - I feel like all I will be able to afford is potatoes if they try and take my money
    - do you have insurance at least?
    - nope I'm bad I can barely afford the lease
    - wow. maybe you need some legal aide :/
    - Ah well I will just go into hiding with my potatoes I love them
