Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/customization/performance#python_or_tensor_args and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n","fold_5\n","precision  recall  f1_score \n","[0.9338978  0.89393939 0.89371493]\n","average:  [0.8574541  0.83315242 0.82539342]\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"abmhsGTAZ-MZ"},"source":["DIET = [0.82527722, 0.78475803, 0.78048493]\n","DIET_Pre = [0.88408369, 0.86262626, 0.85571144]\n","BERT = [0.86630746, 0.85436454, 0.84316159]\n","\n","DIET_p2 = [0.80209133, 0.7843962,  0.76539901]\n","DIET_Pre_p2 = [0.87388326, 0.85353535, 0.84414739]\n","BERT_p2 = [0.8574541, 0.83315242, 0.82539342]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":142},"id":"jTXJlDtROrqY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1629362224315,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":519,"user":{"displayName":"maochun xu","photoUrl":"","userId":"16967829090978487656"}},"outputId":"7ec1648a-466f-47e8-e560-25d22e841615"},"source":["# Pipeline 1:\n","comparision = pd.DataFrame(index=['F1', 'Precision', 'Recall'], columns=['CountVectorsFeat.', 'ConveRT Feat.', 'BERT Feat.'])\n","comparision.loc['F1','CountVectorsFeat.']=DIET[2]\n","comparision.loc['F1','ConveRT Feat.']=DIET_Pre[2]\n","comparision.loc['F1','BERT Feat.']=BERT[2]\n","\n","comparision.loc['Precision','CountVectorsFeat.']=DIET[0]\n","comparision.loc['Precision','ConveRT Feat.']=DIET_Pre[0]\n","comparision.loc['Precision','BERT Feat.']=BERT[0]\n","\n","comparision.loc['Recall','CountVectorsFeat.']=DIET[1]\n","comparision.loc['Recall','ConveRT Feat.']=DIET_Pre[1]\n","comparision.loc['Recall','BERT Feat.']=BERT[1]\n","\n","comparision"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>CountVectorsFeat.</th>\n","      <th>ConveRT Feat.</th>\n","      <th>BERT Feat.</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>F1</th>\n","      <td>0.780485</td>\n","      <td>0.855711</td>\n","      <td>0.843162</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Precision</th>\n","      <td>0.825277</td>\n","      <td>0.884084</td>\n","      <td>0.866307</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Recall</th>\n","      <td>0.784758</td>\n","      <td>0.862626</td>\n","      <td>0.854365</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["          CountVectorsFeat.
