- I would imagine. I am sure they a great kids.
- luckily, they love flowers just as much as I do.  we spend a lot of time in the garden
- I wish I had more time to do stuff like that. Medical school is exhausting. 
- sounds like it. have you gotten any acting jobs, though?
- i just bought a new house with my partner.
- i like to make my own coffee.
- Lasagne
- Oh, I love lasagne. I make my own noodles as well as the sauce.

- Oh really!? That is interesting. I am actually italian myself.
- Awesome. Me and my partner just bought a house. I can't wait to cook in my kitchen.
- Moving in a new place can be a lot of fun. Are you a good cook?
- I like to think so. I love to make coffee for an after dinner treat too.
- Mmm That sounds delicious right now.
- What do you like to do?
- Well I like tattoos and piercings, I am working on my next one right now.
- piercings are cool . i do not have any tattoos though. Too scared. I want some
- What would you get?
- Maybe something for my kids. I've always wanted an anarchy symbol.
- Haha that is a cool idea.
- I like to think I'm cool too. Hopefully one day.
- my parents were divorced.
- i'm a widow.
- My neighbors dog won't stop barking at me. Ugh!
- Thats the worst, is it a big dog or little dog? 
- It's a little dog. Why is it the little ones always bark the most?
- I believe it is due to their behavior and internal and external stimuli.
- I'd like to introduce that dog to my pet snakes. I think they'd eat him though!
- Oh no! But I think black snakes are good? They eat nasty bugs and rodents!
- My snakes are both pythons. I feed them mice. Do you have any pets?
- No, but I would love to have a cat for it to hunt mice in my house lol
- You have mice running around your house? Yikes! I think I'd rather have the barking dogs than that.
- Lol, but they do make great companions at times.I give them bread and they leave me alone for the most part. 
- Have you given them names? If not, maybe we can come up with some.
- i just called them all Jerry, Big Jerry, Always hungry Jerry and then there's the Tiny Jerry. 
- Now you really do need to get a cat and call him Tom.
- Yep that would completely the collection! I am widow so I need all the companions I can get haha
- i have blue eyes and curly brown hair.
- i love to snack between meals.
- I took the train to work the other day and it was so crowded. I was feeling really claustrophobic.
- I would have been too! Do you always take it to work? 
- yes i do because i do not have a car
- if you could have a car what would it be?
- a honda because they are affordable and reliable
- i love the oscar mier wiener-mobile. it reminds me of snacking when i'm not having a meal. would you drive the oscar meir weiner mobile?
- i do not think so, what about you?
- i lost my driver's liscense, ufortunately, but i would if i could
- how did you lose it?
- i did some bad stuff, but that's not important
- im saving up to buy a new camera to take pictures of people who lost their licenses actually
- do you take pictures of people with curly hair like mine?
- no, only people with long hair like mine
- well, you got to do you, brother. i'm proud of you anyway!
- i always answer my cellphone.
- i work in sales.
----------------------------------------------- 67 examples is finished
- that is good . i'm nursing a cold and vitamin c does nothing lol
- oh sorry about that . taking lots of fluids ?
- Yes, thank you. I think I just need some time to make it pass.
- Should always be drinking water anyways, your body needs it!
- Yes it does, especially during summer.
- What do you do for a living?  I try my best in sales.
- I work at a ski resort. I love it!
- I heard Mount Tom Ski Area in Holyoke, Mass is a great resort to visit
- I have never been but I have heard the same. I love snow and the mountains.
- I wish I could enjoy the snow and mountains, I would be afraid I could not answer my cellphone!
- Haha, these days it is amazing where you can get cell service.
- i agree ! that is the main reason I have a phone !
- Do you have any plans this weekend?
- No plans yet, I'm just happy to sleep in for once!
- i love to go out to eat with my family.
- i like to go to the movies.
- He's a good worker but not as reliable as I am. He is always calling in or not putting much effort into his work. I feel I should have gotten that position.
- That's a shame, if that's the case then I agree.
- Yea, but to be perfectly honest, I actually don't work hard either.
- oh i see . i am really reliable in my job on other things i am not
- Well my problem is that I just never had to really work. I always had money. What things are you not reliable in?
- Mostly jobs and children.
- What do you mean children?
- They are food, shelter, child care, health care, transportation, and utilities.
- Ok, Im pretty confused as to what you mean, but that sounds like a lot.
- it is a lot to take care of because kids are a lot of responsibility
- I see. Well good luck with that, I wouldn't know because I don't have kids yet.
- oh well thank you . what else should i know about you ?
- Well, Im going through some drama right now with my sister in law, she hates me. 
- Family conflict is always hard.  Maybe you should be the bigger man and work for peace 
- i work as a teacher and love my job.
- i've two dogs who are like my babies.
- My boss earns way more money than me for less work.
- That must be so annoying. You should ask for a pay raise.
- yeah, i think i will!
- I love my job as a teacher but would also like to assk for a raise
- who do you ask? aren't teacher salaries decided by some sort of... thing, or whatever? i love my family.
- I would ask the school board they base it on how long you've been there and test scores
- how would the principal feel about you going behind his back?
- Not sure, I suppose I could sit down and discuss it with him. What kind of work do you do?
- i'm a garbage man, although i'm a woman. my boss drives the truck, but i'm more qualified, really.
- I've never driven a truck, only small vehicles! How's that working out for you? My two dogs would love to ride along if I did that
- dogs would for sure love a big truck full of garbage. i thik i'm the top 20 or so best garbage men in the area
- oh wow that is impressive . must be an extremely difficult job .
- no.literally anyone could do it. you just pick up garbage. it's not as easy as teaching, im sure, buts ittakes no skill
- If you have patience teaching is great but they test your nerves every day
- i have woman calling me all the time.
- i was once offered to play basketball professionally.
- I got really joyful when my dad got me my first vehicle. It was just a happy feeling
- Yeah. I know that feeling., although I had to buy my own.
- The vehicle was exactly what I wanted, a newer model sports car.
- That was a good choice, What kind of car was it?
- A Mustang GT, convertible
- Nice! Too bad you couldn't get  your hands on a 1963 Mustang II. That's my favorite car.
- A few years ago I helped with a restoration on a 67. It was absolutely gorgeous.
- That sounds awesome. Did you restore it with your dad?
- dancing is my passion.
- i'm terrible at math.
- Dance
- I enjoy dance a lot as well, my daughter does tap dancing. What kind of dancing do you like most?
- I don't have a particular favorite style, but I've always thought tap was the odd one, even though you see it all the time on Broadway.
- Tap is pretty odd compared to the others. My daughter loves ballet.
- i love broadway shows , so this was the closest thing i had .
- Yea, well keep it up, maybe one day you'll be on broadway.
- i hope so. i'm so bad at math. they count 5,6,7,8! at the beginning, and i wish they would stick to smaller numbers
- hahah that's funny. I believe in you though, you can overcome that. 
- it's like a chorus line. the musical with actor michael douglass. have you seen it/
- No I haven't, I don't watch movies very often. Im usually out at clubs people watching.
- when do you think you'll get a chance to catch up on some film? I love dancing, but when I'm not treading the boards, I love watching tv
- Probably not for a while. I just bought a new jaguar and I try to get out and just drive around and show it off as much as possible. 
- wow, i love animals. What does it eat?
- Haha the car not the animal. A jaguar would eat me as I tried to feed it for sure.
- do you hink people like looking at you r car? I heard they are hard to maintain
- i'm a reality tv star.
- i listen to country music.
- i wish i was there
- i saw lots of animals . reminded me of when i worked for a circus .
- You worked for a circus? Tell me you juggled while riding a unicycle and had a monkey on your shoulder.
- No, I couldn't do that.
- Me neither, but that might be because I like to drink...a lot. 
- I drink a lot too because I am a reality tv star and it is stressful
- Are you famous? I'm kind of famous in my own town.
- yes, i am famous. what type of music do you listen to? 
- My favorite singer is Meatloaf, are you a fan of his?
- never heard of him, i only listen to country music honestly 
- Not only is Meatloaf a great singer, but it's also a delicious food. Can't beat that combo.
- Food is the gateway to the soul.
- And meatloaf is the express train to my heart. Nothing like a little hamburg and spices to get things going.
- that sounds delicious 
- i've a masters degree in creative writing.
- i live in a medium sized city.
- I recently got a $50 gift card that I'm really looking forward to using.
- That's awesome. I'd be excited too. What are you going to get with it?
- I think I am going to get a new camera.
- what happened to your old one?
- Nothing but I want an upgrade.
- why can't you just use the one on your phone?
- I am trying to do professional photography.
- Wow. I love writing fiction creatively, and that would make a great story. What sort of phone did you start out with?
- You know just a flip phone haha. Are you working on a book right now?
- It's about these pills that reveal the world is full of dinosaurs, but you can't ee them without the pills, so you don't know where they are
- Oh! Interesting! That would be scary.
- it's a drama, actually, and the dinosaurs don;t bother anyone. would you ever take a picture of something like that?
- Of course! That would make my career!
- oh cool. what sort of shutter speed would u set it on?
- i like lightning mcqueen.
- i have a cat named mater.
- Roommate just walked in on me while I was... trying to... "feel good" if you know what I mean. So awkward. My door doesn't have a lock, either. I told him to not come in, and he just kept coming in!
- I not sure what do you mean, but can use my imagination,  it sounds like something really embarrassing.
- It was. I don't know why I didn't just stop doing it.
- Probably a good idea . Now i'm not sure what to say . An awkward ordeal.
- Neither am I. I'm not even sure why I brought up such a thing in a random conversation. 
- Try not to let it get to you.  Life is weird. Things happen and then you move on.
- Amen to that. Anyway, do you like to read?
- I do like reading. Lately I've been reading about Lightning McQueen. Do you like the movie "Cars"?
- Is that the animated movie?
- Yeah they have made a few of them. I like them so much I named my cat mater after the tow truck in the film.
- Oh thats really cool. Yea I love those movies a lot! Whats your favorite food?
- I love chicken, and Chinese food. Well, just about any food actually. How about you?
- I love pizza, its definitely my favorite of all time. Chinese is great too though. Have you had chinese pizza before?
- Yes! The Chinese restaurant down the street has it. It's pretty good.
- i'm unsociable.
- my weakness are sweets.
- that isn't bad either
- i find that i'm not a sociable person
- that is okay, everyone is different
- yeah I'm pretty different if you get what I mean
- no i do not get what you mean, care to elaborate? 
- well we have  sub personality that tends to control or feelings
- i think the crystals i dabble with can change your sub personality 
- oh wow I hear that stuff is bad for you
- im addicted to the power of them
- I really can't stop eating sweets myself
- you will stop when you get diabetes
- Yeah I was told the same thing, but I'm addicted. unlucky
- meditation will dissolve all addictions 
- I will try medicine first

- my eyes are bright blue.
- i do not have a college degree.
- I am going on a flight for the first time in a couple weeks. I am really scared for some reason!
- Good for you. Is it truly your first time flying on a plane?
- Yea, I have a really bad feeling that its going to crash or something. 
- oh. my god. i never fiinished college, so i'm willing to listen to you explain your psychic visions to me
- Ok well, I had a vision last night that aliens would attack my plane and we would crash.
- we're on the same plane? what country are these illegals from? like hijackers?
- No why would you be on my flight a couple weeks from now? They are from another planet, most likely Jupiter.
- sounds like i'd be better off just cancelling our trip and going back to finish my degree. what do you think?
- Would you? I think that is for the best. It's safer.
- do you have to take off your shoes at airports still? I know like in japan you probably do, but is it everywhere?
- I think so, what Im not sure about though is if they every give them back to you. I think they might just mail them to you
- yeah, there's a fed ex in there for that. Where are you going on your trip?
- I am going to Japan actually but then Im flying right back. I'm really just going for the flying experience.
- Smart. You don't want your airline miles to expire. Are you getting a meal? Maybe a hot towl?

- That's pretty neat. It must be hard to take care of curly hair. 
- Its a long process but I love it
- I have had a dog that had curly hair. It was a mixed poodle and it was red. Really active animal she was. 
- My aunt had a poodle greyhound mix. She was gorgeous

- I liked that it drew upon the actual case of the Zodiac Killer. It made the movie so interesting.
- Me too, serial killers are dark but fascinating people.
- You seem to know a lot about serial killers!
- Well, I think it's important to learn about human nature in all forms, don't you? It's how we evolve.
- Absolutely, although I find them too scary. I prefer to stick to collecting stamps.
- Haha yea, I understand that. I am actually a writer so I have to do a lot of research on such things unfortunately 
- Ah, yes, the lucrative writing career. (Just kidding), What types of stuff do you write?

- Hopefully it is just a sprain. Might not need to receive medical attention.
- It hurts badly so I am afraid I may have to see a doctor.
- Yeah, maybe you should just put some ice on it? It's supposed to be ice on and off for 10 min intervels.We learned that in self defense class.
- Oh that is a good idea, I will be taking your advice. but what if that does not work?
- Could look into doctors in your area that take self pay, some help with making payments and some have programs for uninsured.
- In today's world no one will take pity on me. The pain is excruciating. I think I need pain killers too
- Seriously, I'm also uninsured, wanted to move to Vegas but the rates there for healthcare were worse than my place, I'm sorry 
- I am so sorry to hear that you are in the same boat as me. We really need insurance.
- Would be nice for sure, but not too much we can do I guess, besides the injury anything good happen recently?
- Well My mate proposed to me yesterday, I am so happy

- Exactly! The games today are amazing!
- They really are. It's amazing how far the games have come since back in the day. i still like classic games, too.
- Same here, sometimes I play mario kart.
- Mario Kart was a great game! I was so good at dropping those bananas! Nintendo has become one of the most influential video game companies in the industry!

- you should try to get a job in law then
- If there was any law and order around the isolated cabin and the lake where I fish, I would get into it.

- Confined you might say. And the lake. I can never leave. I love the fishing. 
- i like to go to comic con.

- That is too bad, yes this has gotten me depressed a lot for sure.
- Man I'm so sorry. My mom works for Apple maybe I can ask if she knows of any way to get a job there for you.

- Holy moly, that's some rough luck. Did you find the guy who did it?
- Oh no I reported it to the police but so far they have not found the person who did it
- sounds like you need to take matters into your own hands. The police can't help you. Not when real justice is required.
- I honestly don't know how to go about doing it.
- Close your eyes and let your fantasies guide you. You know what you want deep down inside
- Well, even though I am a jack of all trades I do need some tires. I am so upset
- I thik you're a great person, but you need to stand up for yourself. I have a small dog. It helps me.

- Sounds like I will have to hire some smart people.
- Everyone needs an IT guy, so probably best to get good developers.
- How much does it cost to pay for an IT guy?
- it depends on the specific technologies you are looking for. somewhere between $55-70 an hour is standard.
- Oh wow, that's a lot. Maybe I can get a new grad that is cheaper.
- this depends on the level of experience that your project requires. also the maturity level you are seeking in an employee. 
- That's true. This is more complicated than I was expecting.

- Religion
- Maybe it's the way organized religion works.  Many people paying attention to one person in a room, which means that all too often people think of whatever they want to!  At least that is my experience.
- If you try to look at it from the psychological perspective, religious and nonreligious people are nearly identical. Religious people simply think there's greater meaning behind their actions.
- That is pretty to take in all once can you explain
- People all act the same way, some people just think their actions are more meaningful
- Interesting, but some actions are more meaningful, like I am a vegan
- Why did you become vegan?
- mainly because I wanted to change the world and save animals
- How do you think that will change the world?
- Because I looked in a cows eyes and they were the same color brown as my own
- Do you think cows have feelings?
- Well it felt like I was looking into the mirror of my own soul and emotions
- That's sad. Do you think the cow feels the same about being vegan?

- I think you should try to find the owner and give it back
- How do I know I'm not the owner? Maybe I dropped it yesterday?
- Well, if that's the case that's cool. Did you lose $20 yesterday?
- No. Wow. There goes that theory. Who do you think dropped it?
- I think it was me. Can you bring it to me?
- That depends. Do you like hockey?
